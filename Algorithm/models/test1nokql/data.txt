online making of a market i e the continuous posting of real time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2 The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction 3 The continuous and frequent updating of prices including the operation of the Stack Manager which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person 4 EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language a single line short description of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty 5 The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place 6 It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web based i e the user does not require any system specific software but just a web browser and an internet plug in application 7 The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders 8 Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested 9 The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted

the Seller shall sell an d 20 the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by 20 Counterparty via the Website Does DSO need to be defined somewhere DS0 is a term generally known in t he 20 industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the 20 long description so we chose not to define it also the definition is 20 incredibly long complex and technical If you feel strongly about it we 20 can include it but since the long description tells you how many DS0 s you 20 should include for calculation purposes we didn t think that it was 20 necessary The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me 20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the 20 GTC The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G TC 20 and in the Master Agreement in order to accomodate the way that the price 20 is being quoted on EnronOnline The quote represents the variable component 20 of the Unit Price in the GTC s and the Master Agreement In order not to 20 confuse people we decided to include the formula in both the long 20 description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit 20 Price was calculated using the price quoted Unless industry trading 20 convention is to the contrary the site makes more intuitive sense when the 20 volume quoted and the price quoted use the same

bandwidth is such a new product we really wanted to highlig ht 20 to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth 20 which is what we are offering they will need to establish connectivity wi th 20 us This is already in the GTC but in an abundance of caution we wanted 20 this fact highlighted especially since connectivity will entail further 20 costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation 20 agreements licenses etc this can be quite an involved process The term Contractual Currency is not used int he GTC Can the 20 parenthetical reference

make it DSO s per Bandwidth 20 Unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and tha t 20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per DSO mile per 20 month It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month 20 Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being 20 offered we felt like the quotation was pretty clear We are also a bit 20 sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo ng 20 description From a commercial perspective we are comfortable that the 20 language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number This needs to be 20 clear from the Long Description If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3 20

York Mercantile Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX an e commerce venture that is intended to become the premier global exchange for over the counter OTC forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter party risk management for OTC trading and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position eNYMEX will provide a single internet based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system depending on the session The Exchange s vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil petroleum products natural gas and electricity with some spot cash market products also offered Over time this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals coal and potentially bandwidth weather and emissions Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations In addition to today s launch announcement the key milestones of eNYMEX are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading followed by Internet based order routing for futures trading including a common interface for OTC and futures trading and clearing and settlement of OTC trading Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open independent and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants price transparency counter party credit risk management and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts Mr Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e commerce with bricks mortar The Exchange s established and well regarded clearinghouse which will be used to provide counter party risk management Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets providing significant cashflow benefits to participants

Corp Enron Canada is in the process of negotiating a Master Firm Gas Purchase Sale Agreement the Master with BC Gas Utility Ltd BC Gas In this regard we have recently received a request from BC Gas to amend the applicable law of the Master from Alberta to British Columbia such that subsection 17 12 of the Master would read as follows This Agreement shall be governed by and construed enforced and performed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia without regard to principles of conflicts of law and each Party hereby submits to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia BC Gas has also asked that the applicable law for the guarantee of Enron Corp be governed by the laws of British Columbia While I am fairly sure that we will be able to persuade BC Gas to accept the State of Texas as the appropriate law for the Enron Corp guarantee it seems unlikely because the counterparty is a British Columbia utility that operates primarily in British Columbia that BC Gas will accept any jurisdiction other than British Columbia with respect to the Master Although I have not been called to the bar in British Columbia and there may be some quirks and minor differences between the jurisdictions it is my understanding that the commercial law of British Columbia is generally not much different from that of Alberta Nevertheless I am seeking your comments and consent to such an amendment to the Master Should you have any questions or require additional information please give me a call at 403 974 6708 Thank you for your assistance with this

which will be developed at a desk and or company level The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and require constant changes In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current interesting content on the web site In addition we will need to make sure that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content written audio PowerPoints and video which is scheduled to be included in the Phase 2 launch We will need to sign off on this content within the next couple of weeks I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to develop a process of content approval ",

TOP STORIES NEWS SPORTS BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT Filed at 3 21 p m EST By The Associated Press LONDON AP Patrick O Brian whose celebrated novels of 19th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers has died He was 85 O Brian died in Dublin Ireland where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College The cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date The British Embassy in Paris said O Brian died Tuesday but newspapers and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday O Brian had lived in France since 1949 O Brian s major work was a 20 volume series set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs his readers were gripped by the slow motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail The series begun in 1969 with Master and Commander is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer Jack Aubrey and the ship s surgeon Stephen Maturin a naturalist and secret agent who doesn t much like sailing Although the books were well reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start it wasn t until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the historical fiction genre in which they generally were reviewed In 1991 a New York Times critic called O Brian the best novelist you have never heard of Patrick O Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997 praising the intensity of characterization the complex elegance of the plotting and the brilliance of the writing O Brian also proved that in the hands of a skilled writer specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding Readers who can t remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind and the excitement as a man of war turns to engage the enemy A lexicon explaining O Brian s nautical terminology was published but O Brian didn t think definitions important Ignorance of the cross catharpins is not necessarily fatal he once said Explanation almost certainly would be O Brian s fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley a former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O Brian s originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of history to invent a new style of fiction No other writer Bayley wrote not even Melville has described the whale and the wandering albatross with O Brian s studious and yet lyrical accuracy O Brian guarded his privacy and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life He was born Dec 12 1914 in Chalfont St Peter west of London and it wasn t until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed the Daily Telegraph said in an obituary Friday The newspaper said O Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ but changed his name in 1945 During his school years he was frequently ill spending much time reading His writing career began at age 15 when he published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard During World War II O Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with Britain s Political Intelligence Department In 1949 he and his second wife Mary moved to Collioure southern France His first seafaring novel was The Golden Ocean in 1956 about a Pacific expedition O Brian s Aubrey Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the beginning of the 1990s when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher W W Norton chanced to read one on a flight home The rest as they say is publishing history Several years ago the writer said he would end the series with the 20th book but last month he said he was working on volume 21 the Daily Telegraph reported O Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks A linguist he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and Colette O Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995 Funeral plans were not announced He is survived by a son Richard from his first marriage ", "recipient_address": "christian.yoder@enron.com",

the ETA to govern Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if by some tortured interpretation there is a

RE 09Enron Online Credit Product This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our 20 meeting on January 13 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ es 20 product the 01 Product 018 to be offered by Enron Capital Trade Resour ces 20 International Corp and its affiliates collectively 01 Enron 018 throug h 01 Enron 20 Online 018 These procedures which we will be assisting you in preparing are 20 designed to reduce Enron 01 s exposure to those entities on whose credit th e 20 Product will be based the 01 Reference Entities 018 as well as Enron 01 s exposure 20 to other related types of liabilities We have previously outlined these 20 areas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15 1999 and December 22 20 1999 20 1 Disclosure 01 All Reference Entities should be advised by letter of the 20 fact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the 20 subject of the Product These disclosures will of course be separate from 20 although related to the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to 20 transactions in the Product This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of 20 the Product and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner in 20 which it will be traded e g through Enron Online In general however Enron need not request that the Reference Entities 20 consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference 20 Entities except as set forth below in paragraph 2 20 2 Consent 01 Enron should however obtain the prior consent of certai n 20 types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference 20 Entities In particular consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit h 20 which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or 20 other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t he 20 Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha t 20 could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme nt Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated 20 counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron 20 trades on an exclusively arms 01 length basis with no advisory or similar 20 services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations Where consent is sought Enron should include a request that the Referenc e 20 Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being 20 included in the list of Reference Entities If a Reference Entity fails or 20 refuses to execute the letter Enron will need to make a determination on a 20 case by case basis as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o n 20 the list of Reference Entities However it should be recognized that by 20 requesting consent Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as a 20 Reference Entity in the absence of consent 3 Chinese Wall 01 We understand that it will not be feasible to construc t a 20 complete 01 Chinese Wall 018 between the operations related to the Product and 20 Enron 01 s other trading activities This is due primarily to the fact tha t 20 activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as 20 Enron 01 s other trading activities However Enron should implement a mod ified 20 Chinese Wall between the trading operations This approach would enhance 20 Enron 01 s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety or 20 breach of duty by facilitating Enron 01 s ability to demonstrate that 20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the 20 Product This could be accomplished through a number of procedures First Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical 20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc t 20 on the one hand and Enron 01 s other trading activities on the other hand 20 Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as 20 other traders it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the 20 floor set off by partitions or similar features Second procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio n 20 between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t o 20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public 20 domain In addition all trading personnel should be instructed with respe ct 20 to the procedures through training programs Finally senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit or 20 communications between the groups of traders and to review and make 20 determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would 20 otherwise be prohibited under the procedures These procedures will be 20 similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron 01 s equ ity 20 trading activities 4 Restricted List Enron should establish and maintain a 01 restricted list 018 20 of those entities on which Products may not be traded Initially the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i s 20 not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its 20 relationships with such entities e g those entities with respect to whic h 20 Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their 20 inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives 20 material non public information In addition those entities with which 20 Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to be 20 excluded depending on the terms of such agreements Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of 20 information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed 20 Pursuant to these procedures Enron should suspend the listing of quotation s 20 and therefore the issuance of new Products with respect to a Reference 20 Entity if Enron is in possession of material non public information 20 regarding such Entity of a type or in situations that render suspension 20 necessary or advisable This would include situations in which Enron is 20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity I n 20 addition the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud ed 20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron 01 s possession of information as 20 well e g where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with 20 respect to such Entities 20 The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for a 20 Product held by a counterparty if the counterparty specifically requests 20 Enron to do so The procedures should also address the pricing of the 20 closing transaction however and establish a mechanism for such pricing th at 20 minimizes Enron 01 s potential exposure to liability as a result of its 20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material non public 20 information 20 Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel which should 20 include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi th 20 any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the 20 restricted list 20 As noted we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew which wi ll 20 need to be integrated into Enron 01 s existing policies and procedures In 20 addition as we have advised you in our prior memoranda there are no 20 procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities 20 arising in connection with its offering of the Product However the 20 implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr on 20 in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by 20 Reference Entities Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues 20 K M R 20 D J G ", "recipient_address": "louise.kitchen@enron.com", "email_attachment": null, "recipient_count": 1,

"Apparently there was some miscommunication It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise s office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed As we discussed last week without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities

consent from every reference credit we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them As an initial step I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication Call me if you want to discuss further bs ",

Broadband Services Enron s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day Wholesale Energy Business Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services Enron s largest business Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition Finally Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March 2000 EnronOnline will provide

concerned because the system wouldn t be able to check the appropriate headroom I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship would that be acceptable to everyone Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the

the masters I m not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6 Is this particular to credit derivatives With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9 we need to be aware that these GTC s can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User It is not entirely clear that all sub users will have the authority to amend the ETA Is the purpose of the second sentence to deactivate master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction If so in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties I can t remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control I m sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed 90 days might do it I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days I m uncomfortable with the use of the term Month What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30 You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives should we apply a different interest rate to non US payments It is Mark Haedicke s relatively unwavering policy that US derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason Again sorry for the delay I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points Mark Edmund Cooper 02 15 2000 10 29 AM To Brown Gavin Gavin Brown

changes as well I have made the changes to the US GTC with collateral and these changes should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references to the United States in Section 11 B should remain as references to the United Kingdom in the non US and non Canadian GTCs Please let me know if this is unclear Unless you have any comments on these revisions please could you prepare

the beginning of the year when the Dow was down As recently as mid December the stock price is up about 75 That s one reason why it s so volatile Some people bought in along the way they ve had a good strong increase particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace people just want to take some money off the table As we become more of a technology stock a high P E stock a growth stock held by growth portfolios you re going to have more volatility just like all the other companies that fit into that category Throughout the market technology stocks quite often go up or down not just 3 4 a whack but often 10 12 15 a whack What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the upside but I hate it on the down side We ve had a change in the ownership of our stock Increasingly it s being bought by the growth portfolio managers and increasingly it s being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations and now at these values they want to take

Paucek who produces educational videos and television programs has been taking his golden retriever Hoss to work for the last five years Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co Anchor Jane Clayson The dog has became the office mascot says Paucek He brings a lot of emotion and people love it He s very relaxed But Paucek as co president of his company has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes Not everybody can bring their pet to work A lot of it depends on the dog says Paucek who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog He just hangs out explains Paucek He s easy to get along with Hoss has free rein at the office When Paucek is away on trips My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office Paucek says While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace there are also many legal issues to consider John Challenger CEO of an international placement company agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace says Challenger He points out however that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets in the office policy One of the things that the companies must do before they jump into a policy like that is take a poll of their employees and find out what they re thinking If you have certain employees that don t feel comfortable with pets you might want to rethink the policy There are liability questions as well For example the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect says Challenger The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone it can t be the company s fault Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office Many people are allergic to cat hair You have to think as an employer will you put them in a certain part of your space What about people who are afraid of animals Many don t feel comfortable with them around Just how many do you want Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds What about the noise of birds Paucek admits that when there s more than one pet in the office It gets chaotic In 1997 the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1 225 pet owners They found that 21 of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 76 feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they re on the job 33 said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals If a company decides to allow pets in the office they should poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off limits to pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy destructive or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times If many employees want to bring their pets to the office the company should make a rotating schedule When the pets in the office policy does work it s great Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work I get off the elevator He goes one way and I go the other He says hello to the employees He has his own

transaction has been inserted in the Order Form for data References to Distributor s Subsidiaries have been added in the license grant in Section 4 1 of the T C as well as in the indemnification section in Section 14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor s Subsidiaries Because of the wider scope of the license a Section 16 10 has been added to make clear that if any of Distributor s Subdiairies breach the Agreement Reuters will look to Enron Corp rather than the individual subsidiary The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that Enron s subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs Reuters does not want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant subsidiary to remedy the breach Mark I hope the added

They opened a New York office in the mid 80 s and I went there to help out The office wasn t successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total One of those years was spent working in Asia primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong I ve now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron a large energy company and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically I m actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I m helping them get some products ready to trade online I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town I think I was there the 11th 12th I ve stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M C from time to time Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back unfortunately I haven t really stayed in touch very well There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven t been back for a while of course Woodbine is gone there s a new theater a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations And I understand there are big plans for more they are going to close Sixth Street tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm a big expansion to the sports facilities indoor track pool etc and a redesign of the library Enrollment is up above 1000 Congratulations on your successful career who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well There are doctors bankers chemists and lawyers everywhere you look I guess we really did learn something while we were there Let me know if you ever get to Texas It would be fun to get together and catch up Mark Taylor 1322 Rutland St Houston TX 77008 713 863 7190 home 713 853 7459 work ", "recipient_address": "dsgould@midwest.net",
