losses have emerged in congressional testimony pro vided by a professor and former deriva tives trader who reviewed the Enron case for Senate Governmental Affairs Com mittee Those charges along with allega tions that have surfaced that mark to market accounting was misused by Enron Energy Services the company s retail energy and services unit are expected to support the push by accounting rulemak ers for much more disclosure on mark to market accounting practices and the impact of mark to market accounting on earnings trading firms earnings In testimony Thursday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week Frank Partnoy of the Universi ty of San Diego Law School said it appears that Enron traders mismarked forward curves and manipulated the amount of profits and losses that would be reported in financial statements In a nutshell it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to cre ate false profit and loss entries for the deriv atives Enron traded said Partnoy who reviewed the case over several weeks at the committee s request It appears that Enron traders selectively mismarked their forward curves typically in order to hide losses Traders are compensated based on their profits he observed so if a trader can hide losses by mismarking forward curves he or she is likely to receive a larger bonus Partnoy said mismarking forward curves was not the only problem For each trade he testified a trader would report either a profit or loss typically in spreadsheet format These profit and loss reports were designed to reflect economic reality Frequently they did not Instead of recording the entire profit for a trade in one column some traders reportedly split the profit from a trade into two columns The first column reflected the portion of the actual profits the trader intended to add to Enron s cur rent financial statements The second col umn ironically labeled the prudency reserve included the remainder Partnoy told the committee that in his estimation Enron s prudency reserves did not depict economic reality nor could they have been intended to do so Instead prudency was a slush fund that could be used to smooth out profits and losses over time The portion of prof its recorded as prudency could be used to offset any future losses he said He recommended that investigators question Enron employees who were involved in these transactions to get a sense of whether my summaries are complete Alleged Enron abuses of mark to market accounting
