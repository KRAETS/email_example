Unfortunately that s a daily occurrenc e 20 I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993 when Enron purchased LRC I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company As time went on I got more comfortable with the Enron way a nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish a champion of our hard nose d driven executives at least some of them I bought Enron stock and hel d on to those valuable options Over the last 18 months my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly sometim es daily selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu tives past and present and including you We came up with all kinds of r easons that the executives would be doing this they re so overly compens ated that they have to cash out some every now and then divorce settlement s mistress settlements buying a new home in Aspen buying an island in th e Caribbean etc etc etc We never wanted to admit that they knew so mething we didn t Things were great weren t they Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the World s Leading Company He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate He told us gas traders in Februa ry how the stock was going to 126 by the end of the year Now being the c ynic that I am I didn t believe the 126 although I have to admit I was h opeful I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable i e 20 20 Needless to say I didn t sell my stock and didn t exercise any more option s In fact I bought more stock when it first started going down I m afr aid that there are many more just like me I m fortunate in that I have ma ny working years ahead of me where I don t know to try to build up my sa vings again Many others are not that fortunate So many have spent their entire careers here helping to build this company up They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor And let m e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t han a month s compensation for you Now even that is essentially gone Ot her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t heir children s college tuition The stories are too numerous to list and the more I think about it the more sickened I become It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers as well as the rest of the industry and Houston that Enron s executives knew that there were skeleton s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half truths and mystery mumb o jumbo There should be an accounting for this behavior You and your co horts

the property where Weiner s is now Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America Sweet Mesquite to use City easement along Braes for a patio area Currently that area is being used for parking T he proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so Basically Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts E ckerd s out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick They would also include some plantings greenery etc David Moss is checking with David Allums city attorney about any potenti al liability with Center America Sweet Mesquite using City easement Also there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting David did mention that the li ne is in need of replacement anyway As for the
