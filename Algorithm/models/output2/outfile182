late and still missing a key detail the exact starting location but due to the Round Top Warrenton Antique Fair 100 000 visitors day we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday There is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from Round Top Warrenton and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around these towns Weekly Ride Columbus TX Sat 3 31 8 am This week we ll still get our hill training in and will have the opportunity to climb the same hill Lone Oak that we would have had to climb on the New Ulm route This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in Columbus hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction The Rides Around Houston book gives this ride a score of 9 for exercise potential so look for some hills The ride will start at 8 00 am sharp Columbus is an hour from the Sam Houston Tolway I 10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in Columbus by 7 15 am Directions to the Start Beason s Park We have permission to use Beason s Park as the starting off point Someone is using the pavilion from 2 00pm to 7 00pm and I told Judy that most of us would be gone by then and we didn t really need the pavilion Beason s Park does have restrooms however I will not vouch for the condition Beason s park is on US 90 just east of Columbus The most direct way is to take I 10 to exit 698 US 90 exit and take US 90 west The park is on the left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river For those of you like us coming from Magnolia The Woodlands the best way is to take FM 949 to I 10 We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at exit 698 If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride stay on I 10 until exit 696 Hwy 71 There are convenience stores and bathrooms at this exit At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn right east to get to the park which will be on your right just after the bridge or get back on I 10 to exit 698 NOTE As we get out into the country I highly recommend stopping at the local stores for your sport drinks

14th Floor enter on 40th Street New York NY 10017 A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in mid February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30 devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF backed stabilization program These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country s three party government coalition In response to this instability the Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President Kemal Dervis as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country s fledgling economy Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993 her True Path party led several coalition governments until 1996 After losing her seat in 1996 her party formed a coalition with the center right Motherland Party which was followed by an alliance with the conservative far right Welfare Party The later move resulted in heightened tension between True

Houston Harvard Forum 01 Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence 018 Dinner and Discussion Club Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience Ever wanted to talk substantively about a topic while having a great dinner but were afraid that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in the conversation We have the solution Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years the Harvard Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow club members The format works like this we 01 ll have dinner and then a panel of Harv ard grads will give brief introductions to the evening 01 s topic from their perspective and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves first in a large group and then in small groups The panel members will be knowledgeable but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated They will however be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than ever maybe better than you ever wanted The topic we 01 ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled Our children may be growing up in a world far more affluent privileged than we enjoyed How imperiled is their character by our success What practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the character values that we treasure We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter Because of the format attendance is limited Please respond as indicated below When Friday May 18 7
