Skilling Corp Enron ENRON cc Cory Christensen CChristensen erehab com Subject Follow up re e rehab Just a quick update and follow up to my previous e mail My colleague Cory Christensen another McKinsey alum and I met with IBM regarding a potential strategic relationship That meeting went far better than expected A similar document to the one I sent to you has now reached a number of their senior executives Tom Bouchard SVP of Human Resources for example reacted by saying They re e rehab addressing a huge problem I would love to talk to them one of their senior healthcare VPs stated This is exactly the kind of thing IBM would like to do This is not the only big thing we re looking at but this is definitely big It s right on The table has turned IBM is now pushing us with information requests and to move the process along We told IBM that e rehab is most interested in them as a customer as is the case with Enron and another half dozen blue chip companies with which we have initiated a dialogue However because IBM has come to recognize the relevance and potential value we can deliver they are now keenly interested in becoming a minority investor assuming that we clear their due diligence screens The meeting with IBM last Friday was in Stamford Connecticut so I arranged a meeting just prior to that with Steve Denning in Greenwich Our visit was meant to be purely social but Steve reacted quite positively to our business and would be interested in considering an investment by General Atlantic Partners GAP if we sign up an IBM or one or more companies of similar stature such as Enron Aside from GAP and our current investors we are not considering traditional funding sources GAP is an exception because of their potential non monetary value added In any case the purpose of this note is to solicit a reaction to my earlier e mail In other words would Enron have an interest as a potential early adopter customer and or strategic investor I would not have approached you in the first place unless I was convinced that our services would be of great benefit to Enron If you have an interest in exploring this opportunity I d like to determine and schedule next steps I apologize I don t mean to be pushy but I m anxious and feel a great deal of urgency I ll place a call to your office next week to get a read on your temperature Look forward to getting a
