Tax would be calculated with respect to Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement crossborder trades or a local master swap agreement local trades Execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction Even when any transaction is executed you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal Brent thinks that the tax will be

any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number The only reason for specifying otherwise in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction of the Secured Party as cushion which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be the higher of the amount calculated deemed to be zero if a negative number or the sum of the Pledgor s Independent Amounts the latter would prevail This calculation method will make a difference if for example the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned I hope this helps Sara Marty Oelmann cargill com on 04 18 2000 04 53 26 PM To Sara Shackleton enron com cc Marty Oelmann cargill com Subject Re ISDA Master

of obligations of any kind whatsoever and it is our intent to include only Energy trading under this Agreement 2 Please explain the reasoning for modifying the definition of Credit Support Amount in Paragraph 13 b C of the Credit Support Annex We would prefer to retain the intent of ISDA s definition to maintain consistency in the way this amount is determined among our counterparties Thank you

distinguish these two types of entities both practically what are we able to negotiate and legally what do we really need in our Schedule I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties ENA s form of municipal Schedule the ENA Schedule was essentially taken from the 1992 ISDA U S Municipal Counterparty Schedule the ISDA Schedule In addition to other provisions the ISDA Schedule 1 adds reps designed to avoid an Orange County type meltdown and 2 incorporates the concept of Incipient Illegality which occurs before the Termination Event of Illegality The Incipient Illegality concept is used in Section 2 a iii obligations as well as the Section 3 reps of the ISDA Schedule the concept is added to the Section 3 b rep absence of Event of Default Potential Event of Default Incipient Illegality and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence Interestingly enough the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3 b rep change I think we need to add this change to ENA s Schedule With respect to IOUs we need to clarify our position on Regulatory Development which is actually a watered down Incipient Illegality concept If such an event occurs ENA should be advised of the event Notice But does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at mid market Additional Termination Event or simply to have this event included as part of a Section 3 b rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA s side of the curve for breach of the Section 3 b rep I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the Notice provision can be difficult Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough Arguing for a Section 3 b change may be easier and would mirror the municipal format I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty Thus I recommend that for IOUs we add a notice provision and Section 3 b rep change incorporating our latest definition of Regulatory Development But we really have to negotiate for this protection Otherwise why bother to include this additional language What do you think ","message_mailbox":"shackleton-s","received_time":"2000-01-14

that we add an Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance in its state public utility commission proceedings A copy of that Additional Termination Event is attached for your review Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U S Municipal Counterparty Schedule having additional reps the added concept of Incipient Illegality and an enforceability opinion A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada and if so in all Canadian provinces and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU as we understand that the government may assist

luncheon particularly we some of the less experienced credit folks when we receive a worksheet from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership it may be advisable to ask them the following questions 1 Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity The alternative may be to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit support provider By making the GP a Specified Entity they get picked up in the cross default bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions 2 Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership 3 Whose financials are they expecting to receive the GP s or the LP s 4 If there are financial tests who do they pertain to the GP or the LP 5 How does the LP qualify as an ESP Particularly with some of the less experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the physical side maybe this question should always be asked for every counterparty just to be safe Let me know what you think Carol ","message_mailbox":"shackleton-s","received_time":"2000-02-28
