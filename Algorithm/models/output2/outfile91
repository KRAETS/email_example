21 PM To skean enron com Subject Expert Link Response 30 August 2001 To Steve Kean Enron Request Is ICE regulated by the CFTC Response The Intercontinental Exchange ICE is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission only to the extent the markets are made on the exchange for products that have already been designated futures contracts by the commission ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange would clear cash settled U S oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U S natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U S the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well The fact that the futures trade on another exchange the New York Mercantile Exchange is immaterial The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization DCO Section 5b d of the Commodities Exchange Act as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 CFMA provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements contracts or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements contracts or transactions before the date of enactment of this section This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges as well as electronic only exchanges have been approved by the CFTC Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street Inc appear to be pending A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed Sources CFTC http www cftc gov dea dearegistered dco htm ICE https www intcx com

reporting of trends in our employee population A few highlights from this report The employee base continues to grow though on a significantly slower pace than 2000 Terminations voluntary and involuntary are up dramatically this year Our contribution loss a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving has gone up indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods However those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations EBS the former EE CC and HPL Let us know if you would like

Enron Corp It s hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman s frequent attacks on Enron Enron Goes Overboard August 17 His latest attack is no more than a str ing of misstatements and non sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt He reveals in depth his ignorance of Enron the people who work here and the tragically botched California regulatory regime Perhaps he seeks mer ely to entertain 09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f ree market system a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor skill intellect and heart He would apparentl y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people We disagree finding ourselves less trusting of the i ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders Ironically the example Krugman cites of financialization run amok the electricity market in California is the product of exactly his kind of system with a ctive government intervention at every step Indeed the only winners in t he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange les the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia The disaster that squand ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few not by mar kets of the many So long as Krugman s elitist reasoning prevails we are doomed to repeat such mistakes
