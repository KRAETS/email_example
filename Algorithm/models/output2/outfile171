extension is x35620 As for your matter concerning a contract employee I concur with you and do not believe you are being overly cautious I have worked with Howard during my tenure with EOG and will therefore revise page 2 of the Schedule to Master Agreement to reflect Howard Selzer s name and title You will receive replacement page 2 today by messenger Please do me a favor switch out the replacement page 2 with the existing page 2 so the agreement will be ready to go for execution Give my best to Howard and thanks again Susan Guy Dayvault ENRON 03 09 2000 05 20 PM To Susan Bailey HOU ECT ECT cc Howard Selzer Corp Enron Enron William Watts Corp Enron ENRON Subject Re Enron Global Exploration Production Inc EGEP Susan Good point However our new VP CFO is a contractor and thus not truly an officer of the company We have to be careful of this so I would suggest that the title of the officer you place in the ISDA be our Chief Accounting Officer since that individual Howard Selzer has the signature authority normally delegated to the VP CFO and he is the most senior employee in our department This may be being overly cautious here but it is important that contractors not be treated as employees especially with regard to officers of the company Thanks for the reminder on getting the ISDA returned Unfortunately there is no one I have located yet in our business unit who can explain the document or has seen one before which means I m planning on spending at least several hours reading and understanding the issues implications Perhaps you could help me Can you direct me to someone that routinely works with these documents that could walk me through the pages I think 30 minutes spent outlining the agreement it s nuances would be useful If you have no ideas just bear with me and I ll get to it best regards Guy Susan Bailey ECT 03 09 2000 03 46 PM To Guy Dayvault Corp Enron Enron cc Subject Enron Global Exploration Production Inc EGEP Guy It is my understanding that your VP CFO will be joining Enron Corp s Investor Relations group In light of such development I suggest that page 2 of the ISDA Master Agreement dated August 24 1999 between Risk Management Trading Corp which you have yet to return in executed form be revised to reference the title of the officer rather than the officer s name If such change is OK I will forward the new page 2

modification not sure which it is that financial institutions are taxed Gross Receipts on the spread Is it possible to see a copy I can probably have it translated 2 I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement crossborder trades or a local master swap agreement local trades Execution of the master agreement itself does not evidence any transaction Even when any transaction is executed you are unable to determine net payments owed by either party until termination of the deal Brent thinks that the tax will be

amount among your counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a negative number The only reason for specifying otherwise in Paragraph 13 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent Amounts if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction of the Secured Party as cushion which is not meant to be returned until termination of Transactions and subtraction of that amount would create a negative number when calculating the Credit Support Amount By specifying that the Credit Support Amount will be the higher of the amount calculated deemed to be zero if a negative number or the sum of the Pledgor s Independent Amounts the latter would prevail This calculation method will make a difference if for example the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion such that only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will be returned

entity will never take actual ownership of the securities Therefore I would presume that the Instinet agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation The Posit ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States This agreement however should reflect exactly the same sort of structure language as

06 33 PM To Sara Shackleton enron com Sara Shackleton enron com cc Shin Regina OGC Rshin exchange ml com Subject RE Master Repurchase Agreement with Enron North America Corp Sara Thanks for the additional information and the recommended changes each of which we accept In order to accommodate the deletion of 9 b we recommend revising your number 6 to read as follows 6 Substitution a Paragraph 9 b is hereby deleted in its entirety b Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities under any Transaction governed by this Agreement NOTICES Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially problematic Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA notices may made orally to be confirmed promptly in writing and confirmation of delivery is not expressly relevant The unquestionable ability to make oral margin calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast moving market conditions and was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to their validity In the default context Paragraph 11 proof of delivery of written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party s rights under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice Notice must be given as promptly as practicable We believe that the proposed language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph 11 We therefore request deletion of your number 8 NON ASSIGNABILITY As we discussed earlier today we have a general aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory obligations as a broker dealers For that reason we must be free to withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will not be challenged as unreasonable We therefore request deletion of your number 9 We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED LIABILITY I will also have to review Section 5 1401 of the NYGOL before commenting on that I look forward to the prompt completion of our negotiations Thanks again for the information and recommendations Best regards Andy Waskow ","message_subject":"RE: Master Repurchase Agreement with Enron North

AGREEMENT 1 Credit matrix and 2 Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US 15 million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US 10 million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John Suttle ECT 09 27 2000 12 39 AM To Jonathan Whitehead AP Enron ENRON cc Jane McBride AP Enron Enron John Viverito Corp Enron Enron Kevin Cordesman HOU ECT ECT Mark Taylor HOU ECT ECT Morten E Pettersen AP Enron Enron Steven Kleege HOU ECT ECT Tom Bruce Jones LON ECT ECT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterparty s credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateral credit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating S P Credit Line AA or above 20MM BBB to AA 15MM BBB 10MM BBB 7MM BB to BB 5MM Below BB 1MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think

whereby we don t enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over 2 years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what

Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non financial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a non financial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable ","message_subject":"Re: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT - 1.

ECT ECT Sara Shackleton HOU ECT ECT Subject IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT 1 Credit matrix and 2 Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US 15 million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold

Viverito Corp Enron Enron Kevin Cordesman HOU ECT ECT Mark Taylor HOU ECT ECT Morten E Pettersen AP Enron Enron Steven Kleege HOU ECT ECT Tom Bruce Jones LON ECT ECT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterparty s credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateral credit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating S P Credit Line AA or above 20MM BBB to AA 15MM BBB 10MM BBB 7MM BB to BB 5MM Below BB 1MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON 09 25 2000 08 18 PM To John Suttle HOU ECT ECT cc Jane McBride AP Enron Enron John Viverito Corp Enron

why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we don t enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over 2 years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility

Kleege HOU ECT ECT Tom Bruce Jones LON ECT ECT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non financial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a non financial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the

Und Polach LON ECT ECT Sara Shackleton HOU ECT ECT cc Paul Chivers LON ECT ECT Subject Corp Prepay As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the prepaid swap structure They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying credit default swaps in the market However under credit default swaps only a default on debt as defined by GAAP is included as a credit event and swaps are excluded from this definition This basis risk therefore occurs where Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt This does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection their recourse will then be through the Corp guarantee with time delays To mitigate that risk it was proposed that in the event of an Enron default under the prepaid swap the MTM termination value of the swap would be converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan TD s counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean legal opinion on this structure We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron entering into a loan of 10 1m at the same time as the swap is executed This loan will be in the name of Enron Corp In the event of an Enron default on the prepaid swap this will cross default into the 10 1m loan and that forms the required trigger for TD s credit default swaps The lawyers signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan documentation They are basing it on the May 2000 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are expecting first draft tomorrow I will forward this to you when I receive it The deal itself is still undefined as TD have credit approval subject to presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of credit protection in place prior to executing the trade The confirm term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have forwarded Sara s comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit approval rather than docs until

Schedule to the master agreement EWEB has not yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed legal opinion EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending resolution of the master agreement Most important however is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by the capacity of EWEB s traders to enter into financial trades at any given point in time EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is authorized to act under EWEB s trading policy because under Oregon law and the law of all states financial trades executed by unauthorized persons employed by governmental entities are completely void Your two trades which began as physical deals and were transformed into financial deals were authorized by EWEB s recent board resolution However you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades Before you ever trade with EWEB again you will not be able to rely upon your past relationship with an EWEB trader You will first have to conduct some due diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy ENA has never agreed to this type of

Subject FX Trader in Tokyo 20 Heidi In response to your attached e mail I am attaching the e mail message that I 20 sent out yesterday regarding the structure for the FX trader in Tokyo and t he 20 EM Japan traders You were already copied on this but I want to make sure 20 that you got it 20 In this e mail I explain that PWC Tokyo has recommended following a 20 dependent agent approach for these traders which is what you reference in 20 your attached e mail I recommend this approach saying that it is a 20 pragmatic approach and should be easily implemented I talked with Sheila 20 Glover and Darren Delage about this approach yesterday evening and they lik e 20 it as well In fact they were also copied on the e mail regarding the FX 20 trader and the EM Japan traders The following points should be kept in mind in following the dependent agen t 20 approach which I have already discussed with Sheila and Darren 1 Agency approach Enron Japan would be considered to be an agent of ENA 20 In this role it would facilitate trades that would be entered into between 20 ENA and the third party counterparties The trades would be entered into i n 20 the name of ENA Under this approach Darren is limited in what he is 20 authorized to do and his trading parameters will need to be reduced to 20 writing These parameters must restrict his activities so that they 20 constitute activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character The 20 advice that we received for the FX trader s activities in Australia should 20 equally apply to our facts here The following is an excerpt from a memo 20 that I wrote last year summarizing this advice Guidelines and boundaries must be established on what the financial trader 20 can do e g price parameters product parameters etc Activities cannot 20 include the negotiation of terms of master contracts forwards and other 20 derivatives with counterparties If a master contract must be executed in 20 Australia then it should be executed by an independent agent such as a 20 lawyer having a power of attorney from the hedging party Confirmations 20 should be issued by the hedging party rather than by EA Finance in Sydney 20 The Australian tax advisor recommended that the financial trader say 01 My 20 principal will deal with you within these parameters 01 018 2 Darren s employment Darren must be considered an employee of Enron 20 Japan so as to avoid ENA being treated as having a permanent establishment in 20 Japan 3 Darren s agency role Darren should not identify himself as an employe e 20 of ENA Houston He should make it clear that the third parties are enterin g 20 into the transactions with ENA as principal 4 Service agreement A service agreement must be put in place between 20 Enron Japan and ENA similar to what we did for the FX trader in Sydney 20 Enron Japan should at least initially be compensated at a cost plus 5 20 mark up Yesterday evening I also forwarded to Sheila and Darren by e mail 20 the old service agreement that we put in place for the FX trader in Sydney so 20 that they could review what terms have been previously used Incidentally 20 the service agreement we put in place between Enron Australia and ENA was 20 very similar almost identical to the one that was put in place between 20 Enron Europe and ENA for the FX trader in London 5 Potential issues upon Japanese tax audit Notwithstanding that this 20 approach is easier to implement more workable and more pragmatic in 20 approach we need to be aware that there could be questions upon a Japanese 20 tax audit In that event transfer pricing issues could be raised That i s 20 the auditors could question whether a cost plus 5 mark up is commensurate 20 with what an unrelated third party would charge for similar services We 20 would then need to justify that service fee or if unsuccessful try to wor k 20 out a commission fee that would be acceptable to the Japanese tax auditors 20 Management needs to be aware of this potential I guess I wasn t clear in my attached e mail I am sorry for any 20 inconvenience this may have caused you I hope this e mail better explains 20 the recommended structure Please let me know if you would like to set up a 20 conference call to discuss this further and let me know who you would like 20 on the call Best regards Susan Susan Musch 12 13 2000 06 07 PM To Jan Erland

ENRON ENRON 20 Sheila Glover ECT Darren Delage Enron bcc Susan Musch ENRON DEVELOPMENT Subject Enron Metals FX Traders in Japan 20 Jan Erland I have not yet received the 2001 projections budget for the Enron Metals 20 trading in Japan If you have already sent it could you please re send it 20 Also I talked with PWC Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX 20 trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker McKenzie s advice on 20 not using a dependent agent structure in Japan PWC has advised that 20 although Baker McKenzie s approach is more technically correct foreign 20 traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of a 20 dependent agent in Japan The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs ed 20 using cost plus 5 at least initially Then if the Japanese tax 20 authorities raise questions upon audit a commission arrangement is general ly 20 used with the question being what should the profit split be between the 20 agent and the foreign company Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise 20 questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu de 20 of the trades The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this 20 arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades I have asked P WC 20 to send this advice in writing by tomorrow This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by 20 Baker McKenzie And it should be easy to implement by year end However 20 management must be aware of the fact that PWC s approach could raise 20 questions upon a Japanese tax audit Note that if we follow this approach 20 we would need to set up a services agreement between Enron Japan whichever 20 the appropriate entity is and ENA Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 20 information Best regards Susan HEIDI MASON 12 13 2000 08 38 PM To Susan Musch ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT cc Jan Erland Bekeng AP Enron Enron 20 Subject Re Japanese

here At this stage I 20 understand that the deals are still being done in the name of ENA but ther e 20 have not been alot so again if we can get this addressed before the volume 20 grows it would be best for all I was reviewing this matter with JEB 20 yesterday and he indicated that his preference is for an agency style 20 agreement which avoids the need for the back to back deals 20 With thanks

response to the draft Amendment to the CSA for the above referenced Agreement You will note that I have added some additional language which our Legal Dept prefers to include in Amendments which I trust will be acceptable to you as well As mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day I have also incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is requiring as a result of a review of Cargill s LC language The main issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to its Affiliates If this is still the case we can certainly discuss options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity Regards Mara Alexander Sr Documentation Analyst Cargill Incorporated Tel 952 984 3417 Fax

Shuttle to transport the non walkers Lunch will be served Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282 One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of departmental information sharing activities Since we are faced on a daily basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising the East Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to have Enron s Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current Enron Insurance Programs policies and contractual risk allocation preferences It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to all of the lawyers on the 38th floor Please join us next Thursday Sorry for the inconvenient location We ll make it worth your while with the quality of the food and the presentation

that a ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule normally a MAC in the CSA John s preferance of course would be a unilateral event triggering an IBJ default which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the office after 4 pm Nov 8 in Houston and I could then conference in John Alternatively please

Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US 15 million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US 10 million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John

AP Enron Enron Steven Kleege HOU ECT ECT Tom Bruce Jones LON ECT ECT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterparty s credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateral credit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating S P

HOU ECT ECT Tom Bruce Jones LON ECT ECT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we don t enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over 2 years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito 09 22 2000 12 04 PM To John Suttle HOU ECT ECT cc Jane McBride AP Enron Enron ECT John Viverito Corp Enron ENRON ECT Jonathan Whitehead enron com

last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non financial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a non financial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable ","message_subject":"Re: IBJ ISDA MASTER

an UPDATED book of the consents kept updated These consents must be maintained and kept current If Sam is out of the office we need access to the book 4 We should create a paralegal manual as we go

95 Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we haven t discussed haircuts lately 4 re the Specified Conditions of Tax Event Tax Event Upon Merger and Credit Event Upon Merger FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions and eliminate obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination If a Specified Condition exists then there is no obligation to deliver

before I believe that they can send the treatise background info if you d like 2 The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with respect to the margin lending agreement Bear has

quickly its precisely the decision to include the arbitration clause that makes the language prohibitive I think the gist of the applicable NASD rule is that members cannot draft arbitration clauses which limit the damages that either party would otherwise be entitled to in court Thus the solution if Morgan or the others object would be to draft a clause that is consistent with what New York provides since New York is the applicable jurisdiction I ll find a sample clause I drafted in the past and bring when we meet Otherwise these firms could be fined for including such language I am going to find the applicable rule and make sure that it is still good law but off hand I believe that it is It will be interesting to note if any of the firms object on this ground I may have some

language indicating that the nondowngraded party would have to accept this guarantee subject to a commercially reasonable objection On its face I have no objection to such a provision but would like to quickly bounce it off of you I m not sure that I want to be forced to disclose what that reason is And basically I also have no objection to allowing the posting of collateral in a form and amount

think Bill indicated we probably removed that because we had it this way with the Canadian subsidiary He wants to put it back in I want it back in as well Otherwise we are increasing the guaranty amounts to 25MM and they have agreed to the cross default provisions Let s discuss this when you get a minute He had some additional clarification he needed but these seemed to be the legal issues on

Re BEAR Guarantee letter Here s a recap for everyone Our original negotiation with Bear for the Securities Loan Agreement was in the name of ENA and ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear However Bear insisted that the account agreement was too old and that we negotiate a new agreement I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we ll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc ECI We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement Jeff and Sheila Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not need the Securities Loan Agreement I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp 1400 Smith Street EB 3801a Houston Texas 77002 713 853 5620 phone 713 646 3490 fax

Operating Limited ETOL Sara Mary I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the credit issues for the ISDA With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering into Swaps with other parties I actually do not have the answer to that question so I cannot comment on that I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA I cannot see any reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA We will provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a 50M collateral threshold like in the previos ISDA I further assume that we should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty under this ISDA With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee this is set as 10 000 000 for the previous ISDA Again here I think we can go for the same amount Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss Kind

vacation from June 14 22 seven business days and I don t know who will be able to pick up my emergencies and routine issues I have some idea about Mary s and Frank s workload and I have the impression that Brent is constantly busy with weather I d like to briefly discuss Cheryl s workload I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is project oriented vs routine specific commodity areas and volume FYI I am trying to limit Cheryl s activity with Gary s group to brokerage agreements only The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to cleanup the agreement status It should be winding down I have encouraged Cheryl as have Frank and Mary to provide you with a workload report since we really want her to be trained in the swap basics Also I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell you and me before I leave topic is online trading of

types of entities both practically what are we able to negotiate and legally what do we really need in our Schedule I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these parties ENA s form of municipal Schedule the ENA Schedule was essentially taken from the 1992 ISDA U S Municipal Counterparty Schedule the ISDA Schedule In addition to other provisions the ISDA Schedule 1 adds reps designed to avoid an Orange County type meltdown and 2 incorporates the concept of Incipient Illegality which occurs before the Termination Event of Illegality The Incipient Illegality concept is used in Section 2 a iii obligations as well as the Section 3 reps of the ISDA Schedule the concept is added to the Section 3 b rep absence of Event of Default Potential Event of Default Incipient Illegality and for purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence Interestingly enough the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3 b rep change I think we need to add this change to ENA s Schedule With respect to IOUs we need to clarify our position on Regulatory Development which is actually a watered down Incipient Illegality concept If such an event occurs ENA should be advised of the event Notice But does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at mid market Additional Termination Event or simply to have this event included as part of a Section 3 b rep such that the occurrence of the event merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA s side of the curve for breach of the Section 3 b rep I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the Notice provision can be difficult Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough Arguing for a Section 3 b change may be easier and would mirror the municipal format I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development which we may only learn about through notice from the counterparty Thus I recommend that for IOUs we add a notice provision and Section 3 b rep change incorporating our latest definition of Regulatory Development But we really have to negotiate for this protection Otherwise why bother to include this additional language

Additional Termination Event is attached for your review Our approach with respect to municipals is dramatically different When negotiating an ISDA Master with municipals we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U S Municipal Counterparty Schedule having additional reps the added concept of Incipient Illegality and an enforceability opinion A copy of that Schedule is also attached for your reference We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada and if so in all Canadian provinces and whether there is a distinction when a municipal is an investor in an IOU as

1 Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity The alternative may be to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit support provider By making the GP a Specified Entity they get picked up in the cross default bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions 2 Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership 3 Whose financials are they expecting to receive the GP s or the LP s 4 If there are financial tests who do they pertain to the GP or the LP 5 How does the LP qualify as an ESP Particularly with some of the less experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the physical side maybe this question should always be asked for every

language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out There is no valuation or payment time date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind 4 Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one 5 Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master You don t want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring Also it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is related to the Loan Agreement for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate Is it 6 Defining an event as either an Event of Default or a Termination Event has different settlement consequences It looks like you re not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is related to the Loan Agreement I think part 2 d would be clearer if stated as Additional Termination Event will apply The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty cite events i and ii if accurate For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default Or do you want to calculate at mid 6 You should delete Par 2 a I

thoughts 1 for purposes of creating a template I gave a choice for Termination Date 2 I collapsed Payment Date Invoice because I m concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to

didn t see it in Marketwire and London doesn t use it Also the conversion language is vague i e TTM TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid mid sell Are they references on the Bank

using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage 4 I didn t see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format Regarding Annex A I quickly noticed an issue with the TIBOR definition which uses quite a bit of ISDA language which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference Give me another day or so to comment Let me know if you d like to

to speak with one of you about the Chase and Morgan issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests There seems to be some confusion I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties 1 At the request of Chase and with Jay s approval ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA the Chase Master When the merger is complete anticipated around November 10 2001 the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA s counterparty under the Chase Master See Letter Agreement dated October 24 2001 2 The Chase Master has been amended several times most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues 3 Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule CSA Legal has requested a credit worksheet 4 Among other things it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method This has never been amended 5 The Chase Master is used for FX rate and commodity trades On a different note 5 Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc has signed mini netting agreements with ECTRIC Morgan now wants to sign similar mini netting agreements with ERAC and EGLI I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation 6 Both ENA and Enron Corp have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc Nothing has been executed ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity 7 The names Morgan Stanley Co Inc and Morgan Stanley Co International Limited also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary QUESTION The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name J P Morgan Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement QUESTION Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement Sorry for the length of this message but the word Morgan raises all kinds of questions I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved Sara Shackleton Enron Wholesale Services 1400 Smith Street EB3801a Houston TX 77002 Ph 713 853 5620 Fax 713 646 3490","message_subject":"JP Morgan Chase
