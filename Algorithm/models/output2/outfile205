convenience Also as discussed I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult With that being said however I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas 30 000 40 000 day against a physical gas daily related price Once I have accumulated a payables position we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts paper currently in place I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you
