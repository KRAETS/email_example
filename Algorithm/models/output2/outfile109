separate the two The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter If therefore you have an unusually cool summer the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated and the same in case of an unusually warm winter Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand and would face serious financial losses in such cases Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations It is no surprise then that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher head of weather trading for Mirant http www mirant com In describing weather trading Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997 Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica I Wex Spectron Aquila LIFFE Mirant Bewag Aon and Entergy Koch Weather Trading Europe http www eyeforenergy com weather provided three days of the latest developments in European trading The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market where is it and how to access it data issues the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you ve got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills As weather trading takes its place in the online world there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives

Notice Text All Shippers Letter 02 033 Date 3 15 02 Time 11 00 a m MST Subject System Operations The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest s shippers of how it intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from April 2 2002 through April 15 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests on April 16 and 17 2002 During this time Northwest will have no access to Clay Basin Additionally Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5 2002 and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor have exceeded capacity on a regular basis With Clay Basin shut in Northwest s balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired Northwest will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the Questar and Transwestern maintenance Northwest will take the following steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system reduce line pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance cut north flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling through Kemmerer take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate confirmed nominations entitle for undertakes or overtakes as appropriate and finally if required Northwest will issue operational flow orders If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest s Kemmerer Compressor do not exceed physical capacity Northwest will have much greater flexibility during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut ins Northwest s customers can help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson Prairie storage during this work Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut ins and will be monitoring the situation closely Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate Northwest is confident that if its customers respond prudently the impact of the Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced If you have any questions please contact your Marketing Services representative
