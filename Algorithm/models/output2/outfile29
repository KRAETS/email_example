review Reviewed by Mark Williams SVP Risk Management Citizens Power The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived It has been four years since the first edition was published During this hiatus a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders practitioners and academics The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970 s and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters all of which include an introduction which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics highlighted panels detailed appendices and a separate glossary which provides the reader with additional reference material In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory pricing basis risk delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation For the more advanced reader the chapter on Energy Exotic Options written by Vince Kaminski Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments Additionally the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board s Statement 133 see EPRM October 1999 page 22 Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value The second edition however is not without flaws In particular it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments In the fledgling power market this continues to be one of the primary challenges In summary this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran It is a welcome edition to any risk management library

Kaminski HOU ECT ECT David Gorte HOU ECT ECT Rick Buy HOU ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Subject Re LNG May 19 decision John This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions 1 I was not involved in the LNG ship project I shall read the DASH and give you my comments Without looking at the details I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project please see point 2 2 Elba Island I am working with Doug Rotenberbg Brad Hitch Scott Earnest Sally Beck s organization and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron s LNG related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow Tuesday at 8 30 A few comments on the book design and my view of the project a The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long term contracts or became available due to some short term frictions The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long term contract prices The economics of the deal as represented by the book we are setting up will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US In other words we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction b The transaction will cover the period of 17 years with an extension option of 5 years Even if we can lock in the LNG volumes over this time period we have no ability to lock in the other side of the spread US gas prices for such a long tenor This is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG nat gas spread and I would not recommend locking in only one leg of the spread One solution would be to cover let s say 50 of he LNG volumes for the first 5 years and lock in the nat gas side on the US market side c The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG shipping rates schedules etc I would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market d My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal that are good for Enron and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions Long term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent Vince John Sherriff 05 14 2000 01 40 AM To Vince J Kaminski HOU ECT ECT cc Lauren Urquhart LON ECT ECT Subject LNG May 19 decision

Vince It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch we had together I really enjoyed our discussions both at the technical level and otherwise I promised to send you an e mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer Let s see if we can get a match with your schedule mine is rather terrible Friday 21st of April looks good But April 23rd is Easter Sunday so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around Let me know if that is the case I am willing to visit then because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays Friday 19th of May is the next possibility but this probably is too far out The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research This window closes by the end of April and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford If so doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling then we can schedule it in May I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going Please let me know what you think Best Regards Nick

than a grasp of mathematics a dash of economics politics and logic would not go amiss says John Kay COMMENT ANALYSIS Stretching the figures Calculating accurate values for companies in the new economy takes more than a grasp of mathematics a dash of economics politics and logic would not go amiss says John Kay 87 match Financial Times 24 Apr 2000 12 00 00 am 1170 words Do the math The slogan favoured by Jim Clark creator of Silicon Graphics Net scape and Healtheon has become the mantra of a generation of consultants and investment bankers The new economy they claim requires new principles of valuation C com is one of the most exciting prospects in business to business commerce It is the world leader in a growing market annual sales by 2010 are likely to be Dollars 500 000bn If C com can maintain a 5 per cent share and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be Dollars 250bn If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future revenues at 10 per cent the prospective value of C com is Dollars 5 000bn about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of Microsoft Cisco or General Electric You don t have to wait for the IPO You can buy shares in C com right now for less than 5 per cent of that value C com is called Citigroup and in addition to its foreign exchange trading which is the business I have described you get its other wholesale retail and investment banking activities and a leading insurance company thrown in Of course nobody would be so stupid as to value Citigroup in this way Yet I have followed more or less exactly the methodology recommended in the latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era companies They use precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation of Dollars 37bn for Amazon com Paul Gibbs head of merger and acquisition research at J P Morgan recently used similar principles to confirm that assessment of Amazon He then performed the same calculation for internet service provider Freeserve Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year that 25 per cent of sales take place on the net that portals capture 50 per cent of these that Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and maintains an 8 per cent commission on sales Multiply these together and you establish that in 2017 Freeserve will make profits of o2bn Dollars 3 2bn This he argues justifies a value today of o6 50 per share But I prefer T com to Freeserve T com has a customer base four times larger than Freeserve Its franchise is stronger Its customers are concentrated in the affluent south east of England where it faces virtually no competition Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its customers use its essential services every day many of them several times a day T com also has ambitious plans for expansion At present its geographical coverage is less than one quarter of the market in England and Wales T com has an interest in south east Asia The population of China is 100 times the number of people who today can access T com services Even after the recent market correction T com better known as Thames Water still has a market valuation below that of Freeserve At the widest point between the old and new economies Freeserve was worth four times as much The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is simple but fundamental The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary widely If you buy small quantities of notes from a bank the spread is much wider than 1 per cent If you are a large corporation trading major currencies the margin is wafer thin Entry and competition force prices down to the related costs In Mr Gibbs s model Freeserve earns profits of o2bn about equal to the current profits of Tesco J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer together And it earns these on revenues of only o2 5bn so that profits are 80 per cent of the value of its sales No established business earns margins of that size Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose market position is so strong whose output is so necessary to life that if it charged five times the current price we would have little choice but to pay We do have one option to insist the government intervenes It confines Thames Water to a return on its capital employed of about 6 per cent The idea that profit is a return on capital invested still has some role in new economy valuation at the level of the overall market There is a key formula in the new math The required yield on a security is equal to the difference between the rate of return demanded from that class of securities and its expected rate of growth So if you expect a return of 5 5 per cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per cent calculations show that the dividend yield should be 0 5 per cent This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett in their book Dow 36 000 Claiming that sustainable dividends average half of earnings this yield equates to a price earnings ratio of 100 implying a target of 36 000 for the US index The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to produce what the investor is looking for Investors will receive only two fifths of the cash sustaining the valuation this century One third of the total depends on dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200 Two hundred years ago well before the Dow Jones average prudent diversified investors would have owned slave traders and sugar plantations or perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new economy a canal The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and Microsoft and Cisco may prove more enduring than plantations But we can hardly be sure While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the growth rate of dividends in the US economy as a whole it is likely that well before 2200 most of these will come from companies not yet founded Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett s protests that their dividend growth expectations are conservative If you raise them only from 5 per cent to 5 25 per cent the anticipated value of the Dow Jones average is 72 000 At 5 5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares of US companies are infinitely valuable Not even the most credulous dotcom investor believes that The math also works in reverse If expectations of return are 6 per cent rather than 5 5 per cent the market p e ratio falls to 50 and the value of the Dow Jones from 36 000 to 18 000 And if equity investors require a return of 8 per cent you would have to conclude that shares are worth only half their current level An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for an equity investor A day trader might think you were talking about a weekly profit rather than annual Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5 5 per cent the return on Treasury bonds because they argue that equities have so consistently outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated with equity investment In other words because equities are sure to offer higher returns than bonds the expected yield on equities should be the same as on bonds You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw The rules of logic hold even in cyberspace and so do the principles of economics Profits are hard to earn in competitive businesses and markets that are not competitive are usually regulated The value of companies ultimately depends on their capacity to generate cash for shareholders Distant returns are uncertain Share prices are volatile and investors need to be compensated for the risks These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old By all means do the math Isaac Newton who could do the math better than most gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in the South Sea Bubble In addition to the math you need

there is a position available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open for consideration I would love to connect you to another Rice student Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this summer If so I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone a senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with both his B S and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May Brad has gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years His academic focus gives him a strong mathematical quantitative background and excellent computer skills I believe his skills are transferable and relevant to the Group and he is a deeply dedicated individual If the Research Group is looking for a summer intern I hope it will continue Enron s strong support and recruit of Rice University students Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion As I realize the summer months are not far off

Lane Hughston s recommendation Lane is an acquaintance of Vince and me and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was too old and too experienced Since I felt that Thomas has some merit I asked Houston to have an informal chat with Thomas Houston wish to pursue the interview process further and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews I m somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this since it seems he s trying to put up barriers to these interviews I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he recounts some strange conversations with Anjam He says he received a call from Anjam on Thursday 13th April evening outside office hours asking how he got his CV into Enron I d shown Anjam the email and CV back in early February and how Anjam could contact him despite the fact he was contacting him at that moment Anjam then called Thomas on his work number bad form on Friday 14th asking Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday one working day s notice Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week and that he d have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things at work He said he d contact Anjam on Monday today to confirm his availability Today 17th April Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn t make it and that he wouldn t be able to make it for two weeks not so serious he thought given that we re losing time to Easter anyway Anjam told Thomas that the position might be filled in two weeks time Thomas is concerned about missing the boat and I for one didn t even realise it was leaving so soon Can anyone shed any light on this Steve ","message_mailbox":"kaminski-v","received_time":"2000-04-18

involved in during Risk2000 in Boston on 13 14 June Although I would welcome suggestions to the contrary I would prefer to go straight into the discussion rather than have a series of short presentations first Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic areas around which the moderator can lead the discussion naturally for the better discussions it s important to have varying views on similar subjects similarly it is often interesting to hear the panel s comments on one individual s more specific area of knowledge Conseqently if you could return this email to all panel members with topics you feel should be covered any particular areas you would personally like to focus on any proposed changes to the actual panel structure and possibly additonal panel members you think should be there that would be a good start I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if anyone has any suggestions please let me know The talk title is Effectively Applying

it It then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1 but there are no prices in Appendix 1 I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review In the meantime do you want me to go back to Ms Geman and ask her for more detailed pricing information or do you have what you need Also in Appendix 2 you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to have Please let me know Thanks Karla ","message_mailbox":"kaminski-v","received_time":"2000-04-03

for the Summer of 2000 While the date of my request is later than I would have wished the reason is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get my mandatory military duty done However I now realize I can put it off to a further date That left me wondering if you believe there is a project that I can get involved in this summer and be useful If that were the case I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the summer with the research group I discussed this with Dr Ronn and he is very supportive of this idea I apologize again for bringing

related to our control of market and credit risk To that end Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick Buy Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody s team The questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses We discussed VAR stress testing and potential credit exposure To make a long story short subsequent to that meeting they reconvened their committee and announced the upgrade I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and will continue to be as the bar gets raised I am sure that next year they will continue to be concerned

reluctant to move to Houston but there s no doubt that there is plenty of unnmet demand for derivatives pricing and thinking here in London Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference

take care of personal business and not have to take a vacation day discretionary day or leave of absence If you have advance notice such as an air conditioner repair scheduled please let me know when you are going to take these days If an emergency arises with no notice please call in and let me know that you are taking a personal day It will be coded on your time sheet These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of funeral leave family leave or civic duty leave They are just a way of being able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise These

not autorcorrelated stationarity R squared Akaike information criterion 5 Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed The estimation procedure employed should be briefly described 6 Some diagnostics of model fit vis a vis data set should be presented 7 If possible predictive power of model should be assessed Generally the case study should include all of the items above The
