Citgo gasoline pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor Wilde Construction last May near Luling TX Citgo has incurred aprox 700k of cleanup costs We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo for failing to correctly mark the line Wilde for negligently striking the line and Bechtel for not being present as our construction manager knowing that Wilde was working near the gasoline line The new complication The spill may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000 odd acres parcel affected by the spill If that purchase doesn t go through the attorney for the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be foreclosed and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase price 1 3MM which I doubt he could fully recover since he could sell the property for some lesser amount I am setting up a mediation of Citgo Bechtel and Wilde where John Odam our atty with Mangham Hardy would act as mediator The new info about the land claim may

ENRON Eric Benson ET S Enron ENRON cc Becky Zikes Corp Enron ENRON Becky Stephens Corp Enron ENRON Subject Grynberg Quinque Charlie Tetrault called me today to make sure we were aware of one more billing issue arising out of the above referenced cases A little chronology may help Until around October or November of last year V E s bills solely referenced the Grynberg II case Afterwards due to Northern having removed the case V E s bills included a seperate category for Quinque time Starting in January of 2000 however V E s bills the first one being for December time introduced a third category for Joint Defense Work time This third classification represented work done by V E on the proposed Quinque motion to dismiss for lack of standing etc but not for lack of personal jurisdiction which briefing is being done by Fulbright Basically V E Skadden and one other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of standing etc Substantially all that work has already been done according to Charlie The expectation was that e g Enron would pay V E s fees up front Sonat would pay Skadden s bills up front etc then all those who fronted such fees would recover those payments from other members of the joint defense committee who would be billed pro rata What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50 of the Joint Defense Work time category then the Holland Hart trustee who eventually makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity in determining how the reimbursements will be made Charlie really left it up to us as to what we want to do we just need to make sure that everyone including I guess Holland Hart understands that EOG will be one of the ones fronting the money to V E and entitled to receive reimbursement One the other hand I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if Enron paid 100 of the Joint Defense Billing and accordingly got 100 of any reimbursement so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated Frankly I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50 50 split after he sees these most recent bills given that the Jont Defense Billing is exclusively for Quinque work My thought is not to change how we pay the 50 50 split on the bills we have already received but advise V E that for future bills they can bill Enron 100 of the Joint Defense Billing category Please let me know how you all feel about this B K D ","recipient_count":"1","message_subject":"Re:

ECT ECT Richard B Sanders HOU ECT ECT Subject Re Outstanding Invoice Houston Hydrocarbons Candy I spoke to Steve and Gerald about this last week On the monies they owed us under the gas lift contract we gave them until May 10th to respond or we would institute litigation The attorney for HH Jim Williams called me last week and basically laid it out that HH sold all of its assets to White Oak back in December and we already had been so informed by White Oak that HH doesn t have any assets left and we could go after the principals if we wanted but they probably wouldn t even file an answer and we could just get a judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased He offered a flat settlement amount of 15 000 on our claim of 35 284 95 Steve has given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about settling the 11 000 00 claim for the line repairs Quite honestly I don t hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than 15 000 but that is 15 000 more than we have right now Also since Gerald was working on the gas lift debt I ve asked him to notify credit and put HH and its principals on the credit risk list so that we don t do any more deals
