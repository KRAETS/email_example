MW power plant expandable to 500 MW in the Powder River basin of Wyoming Their angle is that the existing utility Powder River Electric Coop cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin As you may or may not know Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998 ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non producer gathering company in the basin Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP s certificated territory in the next couple of weeks There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this retail market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market However they seem to have some political backing These developers recognize that they need Enron s assistance in developing this project on three main fronts 1 Power Marketing and Project development 2 Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3 Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further Therefore I am wondering if I could get a Sr Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions I don t want to make this email a novel Thanks a lot 303 575

2003 I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity However they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175 000 mmbtu d I have to put that probability at still fairly low but stranger things have happened especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM d Probably the entire project is still less than 50 but it is obviously
