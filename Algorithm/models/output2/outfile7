teenage boy in 1994 the other currently being held in the Wellington Remand Center on charges of incest with his three children I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who lives in the Bronx and indeed is still a part time working girl in a brothel however her time there is limited as she has recently been infected with an STD We intend to marry as soon as possible and are currently looking into the possibility of opening our own brothel with my fiancee utilizing her knowledge of the industry working as the manager I am hoping my two sisters would be interested in joining our team Although I would prefer them not to prostitute themselves at least it would get them off the streets and hopefully the heroin My problem is this I love my fiancee and look forward to
