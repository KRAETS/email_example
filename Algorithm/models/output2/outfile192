changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone s mind Would it be okay to delay EOL market making in basis until 8 30 I think it would be worth it I

affect ENA s basis positions Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions Should we set up a new book under my management which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and or more complex structured positions I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being cluttered up in different books i e the P L from
