America The Good Neighbor Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a Canadian television commentator What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956 it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help This spring 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering Americans I d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet the Lockheed Tri Star or the Douglas DC10 If so why don t they fly them Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at Even their draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble I don t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake Our neighbors have faced it alone and I m one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope Canada is not one of those Stand proud America This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States It is nice that one man realizes it I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it We are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web I am just a single American that has read this ","message_subject":"","sent_time":"2001-09-13

1 When we talk about the market reacting to events what are the prices that we are talking about From a simulation standpoint I am trying to figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many events Is it the forward curve Is it the spot market price Is the bid offer prices for the various instruments And if we are having users trade basis we will need different prices for different locations right Quigley Dutch for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve Question 2 Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved we decided that it would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model However we understand that the user needs to 1 know their VaR and 2 know that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit So we will need to set a VaR limit for the user and fake the individual VaR to reflect their risk exposure I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this He made a good point that if our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is calculated will they know how to control their VaR i e if a user sees that he is over his VaR limit what should he do to get it back within the limit Is is as simple as not being too long or too short And if that is the case would it be sufficient to use position reports tallies as a proxy for risk exposure instead of VaR One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how exposed the user is So if they are X dollars long they have a VaR of Y If they change their position so that they are now 1 5X long they have a VaR of 1 5Y Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account market volatility What are your thoughts Quigley Dutch Instead of a VaR number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times i e over all position can not be outside a set range NYMEX Risk can not exceed 500 contracts Basis Index Risk can not exceed 1000 contracts so for and so on Therefore not having to calculate VaR and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits Lastly when could you meet with me next week I would really like to meet on Tuesday if possible Quigley Dutch can you check with your team I am to meet with them on Monday and Tues so see if you can

toxic and yet their actions can open upward flowing paths Take Enron the energy company or Chevron another energy company or El Paso Natural Gas yet another energy company These organizations are the minions of Satan They pillage and they profit They are in the ascendant Their enemies fall before them like cordwood Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute And yet we thank them We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail but we thank them They have shown us the nature of our enslavement They have defined the nature of our sloth We have believed the Big Lie We have believed in the free lunch We have trusted those who would pander to us We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs Did we know it was not infinitely renewable Oh yes Did we understand that energy companies could create shortages whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for maintenance You bet we did And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature We did not But it was more convenient to forget those things and so we did We have busy lives We must do the things we must do The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling and we are patching it up ourselves We are paying bureaucrats with taxes but the bureaucrats are inadequate so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don t AND SOMEHOW EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one we forgot about our own checking accounts Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn t need I m not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down

Security that is means testing a pension plan You gave us the money we kept it for 40 years now prove that you need it Why did he suggest that Because he can Why did PG E demand additional compensation for its executives who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition Because they can get away with it They will get away with it You watch I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves There are active villains and there are people who allow villainy to occur Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt The fools are the ones who don t end up with any
