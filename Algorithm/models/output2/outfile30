better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going If we have specifically committed to certain things then let s follow through If there are things we can avoid let s avoid them Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel With respect to the Hills firm can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions These are the kinds of things we need to consider Joe Hillings ENRON 04 19 2000 04 13 AM To Steven J Kean HOU EES EES cc Subject Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO Steve This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for your consideration and decision We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually I m not quite certain that is possible at this stage you need to know the following The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva Committee on Specific Committments spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS General Agreement on Trade and Services The USTR raised the issue tabled the issue and guided the discussion We did not send anyone to that session As planned for several months we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization He raised the issue of Japan s industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle Now he has told Bob Vastine president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement We ll hear more tonight Later today the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance This is a decision point for you We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it the SCO FSN Showcase Europe in Houston with you and Rick you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union They are important points of contact for our commercial people This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later I have organized the dinner Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives This is a dialogue on energy services The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy Rick s memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC Therefore unless we participate Europe s energy industry is not talking with US industry If this is what you want then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth Secretary General of the BIAC Business Industry Affairs Committee to the OECD This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e commerce and services Doug an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future I had planned to be there with Ken for the day day and a half he will be in Paris I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us Well these are the near term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm However if you want to exit other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision Joe ","message_id":"<18505513.1075846375160.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","sent_time":"2000-04-19
