summarizing the issues complete tomorrow there will however because the final terms of the assignment agreement assigning the GE contracts to Mitsui have not been agreed to by Mitsui that will make one element of the memo contingent on finalization of that assignment agreement form We sent Mitsui a draft of that assignment agreement some time ago but they have not yet responded It is likely that they are waiting until they get a letter from EEIM which indicates that Mitsui will be paid for certain Pre NTP work before Mitsui finalizes the for of the assignment agreement I understand that a letter regarding such payment to Mitsui is being sent to them by Steve Irvin today Once my memo is complete I will forward it to Brian Barto among others and hopefully there are some items that he and

To briefly answer your questions we are contemplating another layer of documents with the EPC contract There will also be a Development Agreement that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee I don t read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract Let s discuss tomorrow Also we ve told Bob Wright that if the plants don t work the state gets its money back I think he and everyone involved would be amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price accompanies the reduced performance to the 10 percent floor of course This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only The Development Agreement will cover our fee So no our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform We will have some risk on BOP if the plants fail What time works

room for multiple contracts Does anyone care 3 Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests We have discussed with FCE the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent then a full reduction as to the failing unit s only Also are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee Is our fee at risk for

Contract namely the recitals and sections 3 8 c 2 5 1 6 1 7 2 4 30 7 and 30 12 The references in the recitals 3 8 c 7 2 4 30 7 and 30 12 can be handled fairly easily The references in 5 1 and 6 1 deal with pricing matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked out with GE My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising from the discussions with GE PLease let me know what you think Regards Paul Kay Mann enron com 10 24 00 12 37PM Thanks This is a very drastic situation so the

that if we use an LLC we have the option to see he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights obligations for financing purposes or otherwise In that case we may want to use an LLC instead of

protect Enron s interests 1 Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2 that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement This language has been included in the attached draft My goal however optimistic is to execute the risk policy by the end of today Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is

encourage the administration to not take lightly the indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act The act was beyond offensive it was criminal especially in light of the young children present During the first act I was sitting on the first row and there were 4 young children sitting in the front In fact at the end of the first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige s six year old brother to watch her perform I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring Michael Even I was offended and I m a forty two year old lawyer we don t offend easily who was in a sorority at UT I was glad I had moved back at intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act Again I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion It was offensive to the individuals

the strength of the U S dollar interest rates and many other influences As such giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear market would be misleading Where the government has greater influence is in such things as military spending and more critically the choice of Fed chairman said Arnold Kaufman editor of the S P Outlook an investment publication published by Standard

Strawn about a new ADA We will need to contact GE about the transfer actually it will be two transfers one to WLB and then into the Developer in the CSFB structure Who at ENA legal should I work with to get that process started Both Rob and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer Austin The Austin turbines are the LMs that purchase agreement contemplates that the new buyer will execute another agreement with GE S S covering the turbines it acquires Is that structure still contemplated Is there another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective I assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or EPC contractor also CSFB Structure More generally we will need to get buy in from vendors on the assignment of the purchase

Dow Jones In response to new California power market rules proposed Wednesday by the U S Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Enron Corp ENE news msgs has canceled some new generator projects it was discussing with the state s electric grid operator Enron said The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring Enron said The company however continues to negotiate other new generator projects with the California Independent System Operator The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange s price setting mechanism to 150 a megawatt hour The preliminary order could become a federal mandate by the end of the year after the FERC takes comments from the public or it could be modified Enron and 13 other companies meanwhile are in final negotiations with the ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer The ISO plans to pay a total of 255 million a year for three years to the power companies for installing the new generators which the power companies will own In addition California s three investor owned utilities would pay the generators for any electricity the new generators produce Pricing for the power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state chartered CalPX There s too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost associated with those specific projects For the purposes of making capital commitments we view this as a 150 price cap Enron s Mark Palmer said Earlier Wednesday the ISO s chief operating officer Terry Winter expressed concern that FERC s proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects FERC s proposals Wednesday are the result of a two month investigation of California s wholesale electricity market where prices this summer were three times what they were a year earlier To meet the state s rising demand for power California s three utilities have paid billions of dollars more than

07 AM Mail this article to a friend DANBURY Conn BUSINESS WIRE Nov 2 2000 New Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell TM Power Plants FuelCell Energy Inc NASDAQ FCEL news msgs announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company s Direct FuelCells R DFC R for coal mine and remote location applications The first contract is for a 5 4 million project with the U S Department of Energy DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory NETL for the design construction and operation of a 250 kW DFC utilizing coal mine methane gas at the Harrison Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz Ohio The second contract for 100 000 is from the U S Coast Guard Research and Development Center in Groton Connecticut for a remote location 3 kW fuel cell power system using methanol for fuel It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story near Virginia Beach VA Coal Mine Methane Cost Free Fuel Reduces Emissions FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere Costs for the three year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell Energy As a result in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades said Mark C Williams fuel cell product manager for NETL This application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions According to FuelCell Energy 75 of the world s coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations A total of approximately 1 000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources The U S alone has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity At an estimated 1 000 kW the 1 000 MW worldwide potential for FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a 1 0 billion market The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in benefits for all concerned said Jerry D Leitman president and CEO of FuelCell Energy Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated By using it to fuel a DFC power plant a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion An important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early adopter markets The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells facilitating early adoption by energy users Remote Power Clean Energy Where the Wires End The U S Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell Energy a 100 000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape Henry Lighthouse for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites The Coast Guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations radio navigation stations weather stations and aids to navigation such as lighthouses structures and buoys Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation The methanol fuel allows for simpler more compact process equipment for FuelCell Energy s Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote unmanned site in a marine environment said Walt Lincoln project manager of the U S Coast Guard Research and Development Center We re interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world such as pipeline monitoring microwave relay stations and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells said Leitman Using carbonate fuel cell technology the DFC R power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro chemical reaction rather than through combustion This method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process About FuelCell Energy Inc FuelCell Energy Inc www fce com formerly Energy Research Corp is a leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power generation The Company s Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel This results in a product whose cost combined with high efficiency simplicity and reliability results in product advantages for stationary power generation FuelCell Energy based in Danbury CT is developing Direct FuelCell R power plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW 1 5 MW and 3 MW The Company has been developing DFC R technology for stationary power plants with the U S Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory NETL The NETL s advanced fuel cell research program is focused on developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer including hospitals schools data centers and other commercial and industrial

hasn t seen any of this language It was something I pulled together for you to look at As for FCE s desire to assign in case of merger etc I think the language is too broad In fact I think assignment by them should require our consent Otherwise it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff the know how the patent rights the manufacturing facilities etc If they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares they don t need an assignment clause unless there is something peculiar in Conn law They only need assignment language for an asset sale

3 except with no specific ownership requirement My reading of 2 is that it allows 3 but 3 narrows 2 4 My guess is that FCE will want condition 6 a to apply to all the assignments 5 Has anyone from Deffner s group approved this language 6 My guess is that FCE will reject this language as being too broad Have you run it by them 7 For condition 1 to apply to CRRA would we have to assign the

project company partially owned by Enron ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company Also the ABB and GE payment schedules are different with GE being more front end loaded For example GE will have received 45 of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship they will have received 95 of the payment In contrast we hold 25 of the price of each ABB unit until delivery 15 and acceptance 10 of that particular unit Effective date The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates In the GE contract we addressed the issue in section 30 3 stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle It is fine with me to make the effective date a current one

additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series The batting pitching and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers said the Mets batting coach We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls but actually swung at curve balls It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter league play earlier in the year The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit said the Mets batting coach The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game While some of the strikes called against the Mets were in fact balls there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World series the commissioner said Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that based on on base percentage the Mets had actually won the World Series regardless of the final scores of the games It s clear that we were slightly on base more often than the Yankees said a Mets spokesman The World Series crown is rightly ours The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion engaging in some light jogging for exercise He has stated that he believes we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment ","message_subject":"Breaking

intervention the approval time will depend entirely on Staff s approach In the last year I handled one affiliated interest agreement approval which required only five weeks from filing to the time of the Order Staff viewed the agreement as non contoversial and wanted to dispose of the matter quickly In another case with staff copperation the time from filing to approval expected today was nine weeks On the other hand when staff perceives an actual or potential issue cases can drag on for months I am handling one approval proceeding involving acquisition of a small water utility system which is expected to require about nine months to complete In that case staff argued that it needed 3 4 months to complete discoverey and prepare its direct evidence Time was also included for two separate rounds of testimony which is standard at the ICC the hearing briefing issuance of Examiner s order and filing of Exceptions and Replies If Staff seeks to schedule all of the available procedural steps which it can do if it so chooses it is difficult to complete a case of this type in less than 6 months A realistic time frame for a contested case would be 5 9 months To avoid this it is important to meet with the staff early on and resolve their concerns informally This should be done if possible before the first scheduling conference likely to be held about 3 weeks after the Petition is filed If agreement is not reached beofre the first conference with the Hearing Examioner the established schedule for the case should build in one or more early status conferences which provide the opportunity

Companies with no earnings Market capitalizations in the billions even though revenue hovers in the tens of millions Analyst optimism bordering on the feverish We know this probably sounds all too familiar But this time we re not talking about some pie in the sky dot com stock valuations We re talking about companies with new technologies tangible assets and a clear source of future revenue We re talking about makers of fuel cells a highly efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity And while we won t deny that the recent run up in their stocks befits the pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad we at Red Herring expect that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time Investors more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop reading here There s no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy they provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than traditional generating sources see Trend No 9 Energy December 4 Most only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as by products both of which are reusable Simply put fuel cells consist of hydrogen and oxygen separated by a catalyst Typically the fuel cell is heated causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity Since nothing is burned no pollutants are created In time proponents say fuel cells will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that manufacture them During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in the last 12 months That s despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit they took in the spring The Nasdaq by comparison has fallen 15 percent since last November Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs H Power Nasdaq HPOW Millennium Cell Nasdaq MCEL and Proton Energy Systems Nasdaq PRTN all went public within the past few months While those IPOs may seem to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel that s not the whole picture We re seeing a convergence of factors never seen before says William Fogel a power technology analyst for First Albany The deregulation in the utility industry has increased innovation the transportation grid is in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet based economy there s a growing need for increased reliability and there s an increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the combustion engine Admittedly truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away so profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies But investors have proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become mainstream buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations Still holding JDS Uniphase Nasdaq JDSU With early stage fuel cell technology due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers within the year this is still the early part of the adoption and investing curve CELL DIVISION The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments stationary portable residential and automotive Fuel cells will likely hit the large stationary market first powering strip malls and factories according to David Redstone editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter We re talking about unprecedented efficiency he says noting that fuel cells approach 60 percent efficiency that is 60 percent of the potential energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 percent whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent efficiency The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell Energy Nasdaq FCEL FCE which is poised to be the first to commercialize them in 2001 At first blush FCE s 442 percent run up in the last 12 months and the fact that it won t be profitable until 2006 doesn t make its 59 50 stock price and price sales ratio of 58 seem cheap But using a variety of metrics including discounted cash flow discounted 2006 net income and discounted 2006 revenue Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE undervalued by 40 percent Using a projected market value of five times estimated 2006 revenue of 1 billion she applies a discount rate of 17 5 percent annually to arrive at a 12 month price target of 124 Portable applications for fuel cells like generators and boat engines are also expected to be commercialized soon Ballard Power Systems Nasdaq BLDP with more than 370 patents issued or pending has proven itself in nearly all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel cell powered generator to market in 2001 They don t make promises they re not able to keep says Christine Farkas a senior specialist and director at Merrill Lynch They ve never disappointed Ballard has also made significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler NYSE DCX and Ford Motor NYSE F Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004 and its current price to sales ratio is a whopping 265 Still Ballard s involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms Farkas to expect the company to earn 24 22 per share by 2013 which works out to approximately 2 2 billion in net income Applying a multiple of 25 to those earnings and a 15 percent discount rate she comes up with a projected stock price of 150 a year from today or 93 percent above recent prices INDUSTRY REVOLUTION Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off the notion has found allies in some unlikely industries the major oil and automotive sectors Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr declared at the 2000 Detroit Auto Show Longer term the fuel cell will end the 100 year reign of the internal combustion engine Legislation such as California s mandate that by 2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold an estimated 22 000 must run on alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance While not a pure play on fuel cells Impco Technologies is well positioned to see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel delivery storage and power electronics systems Mr Fogel expects Impco s products to compete for 40 percent or 5 billion of the forecasted 12 5 billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010 Its much more down to earth P S ratio of 1 6 is an added attraction for investors any risk involved in Impco s fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the alternative fuel industry They re involved with almost every aspect of General Motors s global alternative fuel production design and implementation efforts Mr Fogel says Impco was hit particularly hard this spring and is still at 18 65 percent off its March 6 high of 52 But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 earnings per share of 2 86 and applying a 20 percent discount Mr Fogel arrives at a price to earnings to growth ratio of less than one a conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects Mr Fogel sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company s stock expecting it to return to its high in the coming 12 months Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios there will inevitably be setbacks Take for example Plug Power Nasdaq PLUG which ran out of gas when General Electric NYSE GE which owns one third of a joint venture with Detroit Edison NYSE DTA and Plug decided to change course Plug s trailing 12 month revenue of 13 million giving it a price to sales ratio of 64 hinged on the venture in which a fuel cell powered a house independent of the local electrical grid Instead GE now wants to develop a grid parallel system which would work in tandem with the existing system That news coupled with management woes and Nasdaq turbulence sent Plug s share price falling 80 percent from 140 on March 13 to 16 50 on November 24 It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate to get that stock back on track Discuss energy trends in the new economy in the ongoing Energy Industry Moves Forward

information GSS provided the deal expertise and DealBench provided the technology These illuminated exit signs which will be used in the new Enron building and in commercial buildings of our customers are big energy savers Whereas exit signs typically use 40 watts the new signs use 4 watts In addition typical exit signs use fluorescent or incandescent lamps The new exit signs use light emitting

set for Tuesday Lenders will want a certificate of insurance for these LM6000 turbines No Brazilian Elektrobolt project insurance is in place as it is not required at this time so we will try to issue certificates under the Enron Corp program for these while they are still located in the States Once they are loaded on the vessel the project specific cargo policy will go into effect I need any insurance requirements in any contracts pertaining to these turbines I have seen none so far I will also need exact wording to put on the certificates of insurance with respects to the names of all loss payees and are they named and waived As this is a short time frame please answer the information below today if possible as I need it before I can proceed any further Depending on the data hopefully we can utilize the Enron Corp program in the interim If not we will need to secure interim coverage and that could take some time Also please send me any supporting data such as insurance

plant here Enron North America one of the world s largest energy conglomerates has proposed a 510 megawatt plant for a 30 acre site south of Sample Road and east of Florida s Turnpike Company officials hand delivered the check last Friday requesting that the money be used for cultural arts programs The city manager returned it on Tuesday While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate support of the community the timing of your donation has the potential of creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose City Manager C William Hargett Jr wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky director of Enron Therefore I am returning your check The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city s Planning and Zoning Board later this month Eventually the issue will come before the City Commission The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the plant on May 1 2002 It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County and the third largest City officials applauded returning the check to Enron I think their intentions were very questionable said Commissioner Kay McGinn The city did the honorable thing in returning the check We have been talking about cultural arts But did they do it for something in return asked Mayor Bill Griffin The best thing we did was to return the check There wasn t anything improper about the gift said Eric Thode spokesman for Enron The city has a right to its opinion I would say Enron nationwide has been recognized for its philanthropic activities We want to be a good

bronchitis and other breathing problems The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1 500 hours a year according to its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is over and the timing is better Enron will come through financially Hopefully Enron will continue its support of the community and consider a

addition you can tell people that Jason Peters of Andrews Kurth also helped in the review and editing of the contract If you want to call him directly he can describe the deal to you he indicated that he has worked with you Lastly you will need to fax an executed copy of the agreement to Babak Hoghooghi of the Washington DC office of Skadden Arps and will need to federal express the originals to

following 1 Regarding the transformer the contract counterparty is ABB Power T D Company 2 The purchase price of the transformer 786 000 was taken from the WLB financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges or option payment total 56 803 allocation that Global Finance has included in the calculation of the Payoff The full cost of the transformer would be 842 803 3 The purchase price of each turbine 14 072 000 was calculated as an average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE This price does not include the 280 000 in change order costs allocated to each machine The full cost of each turbine should be 14 352 000 The 280K in change order was picked up in the original payoff prepared by Global Finance Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current payoff determined by Global Finance I will talk with him first thing in the morning We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values Fred ","message_subject":"Re:

Enron Enron Kay Mann Corp Enron Enron dgholke skadden com ROB TAYLOR TAYLR andrews kurth com Subject Re ESA Documents needed to complete the Eletrobolt EPC No he wants to see the breakout but generally the commercial ts and cs are the same The breakout should be different only insofar as technical type changes were made to accommodate a smaller batch of turbines and certain other site specific changes The override letter contains the financing type changes that need to be in these surrogate purchaser deals The idea is that once the financing entities are out of the picture and we want to sell the facility the breakout turbine purchase agreement can be assigned to the new owner without the funky overrride letter requirements Brett s question went to whether EECC would be critical of the commercial deal terms because oddly enough EECC has historically been the point organization for all power asset purchases within Enron whether the purchase was ultimately for an ENA ESA or EECC NEPCO project In this case Brett can be assured that EECC had its input into the commercial terms last May when Kay Mann ENA power development lawyer worked with Katherine Clark an EECC

to stock up on soft drinks juice or other things like that since it would make Daddy suspicious I ll probably bring Pop Tarts for the kids breakfast on Sunday Plus drinks and juice Also do you know if we will be having birthday cake for desert If not let me know and I can always bring one I ll bring Bud and wine and kid drinks Anything else I can t believe we were able to go and visit and not spill the beans That s pretty good for us I wish we were still on vacation but I guess you have to come back to the real world sometime When we got home we had phone messages from Bobby s sister and aunt and a note from his dad I think I ll wait and talk to them tomorrow They take a lot of energy you know Tell your family hello for me We are all looking forward to seeing you guys at the pink house

understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group something like that and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA I do not know their function or role As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document I would say that it would depend on the comment Essentially the deals are ENA deals not EECC deals which means ENA has decision making responsibility Also ENA is the project sponsor owner until sold and NEPCO is usually the contractor The conflicts arise when NEPCO usually not EECC on ENA deals is asked to wrap certain contracts so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a contractor So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner s engineer and the EPC contractor Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the negotiation process Perhaps this has changed since I left but that was how things worked when I was with EECC On the finance deal lawyer front my question is who deals with the lenders and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place I ll let you know if I think of anything else I suspect Sheila will have some insight also Kay

electric power distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to retail customers passes antitrust muster according to a Jan 10 business review letter by the Justice Department s Antitrust Division which could find no lessening of competition in any electric power market The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide electric service predominantly to rural consumers Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member consumers that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income to its member customers Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act which mandates competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan 1 2002 the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas will change greatly Consumers now purchase electricity only from the regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is located Under the Act a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace and the consumer s incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer s door under regulated distribution charges The new legislation s primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing activities which will be completely competitive from the electric utility s regulated transmission and distribution activities To ensure that the utility s marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its relationship with the utility the Act provides that employees engaged in the transmission and distribution system operations are required to function independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at retail The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an alternative energy service provider Distribution cooperatives under the act may serve these consumers referred to as default consumers directly or they may assign them to an affiliate The rates for the standard service package will be a market rate unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers throughout Arkansas All retail marketing activities outside the traditional local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through the joint marketing venture If a distribution cooperative decides to withdraw from the joint venture it may compete with the joint venture for any and all consumers The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its default customers to the joint venture Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric power generating capacity in Arkansas and the combined generating power capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint venture is likely to market The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets than would be attainable by individual members Procompetitive Effects In the business review letter Acting Assistant Attorney General A Douglas Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not appear to have any anticompetitive effect He commented that while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as potential entrants into each other s local retail markets regional markets and a state wide market their small size and relatively high operating costs make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that if they tried to enter they would offer effective competition Melamed added that the existence of other larger potential entrants into the local retail markets would significantly diminish if not eliminate any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture proposal It seems at least as likely if not more so that the joint retail marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the distribution cooperatives The business review letter is available at http www usdoj gov atr the Antitrust Division s Web site and a file containing the business review request and the division s response may be examined in the Antitrust Documents Group of the Antitrust Division Suite 215 Liberty Place 325 7th St N W Department of Justice Washington DC 20004 ","message_subject":"Ok, it is a slow news

the signing of an agreement to install a Direct FuelCell R 20 DFC R power plant using municipal wastewater digester gas as the fuel 20 FuelCell Energy was selected for the project through a competitive process 20 last July to install and operate a 1MW DFC power plant at the County s Sout h 20 Wastewater Treatment Facility in Renton Washington King County The two 20 year demonstration project is cost shared equally by FuelCell Energy and Ki ng 20 County through a cooperative grant to the County from the U S Environment al 20 Protection Agency EPA Total value of the contract is 18 8 million 20 Operations are expected to commence during the third quarter of 2002 20 This megawatt class commercial field trial of the DFC power plant represen ts 20 the first advanced wastewater digester project for FuelCell Energy said 20 Jerry Leitman president and CEO of FuelCell Energy This project will 20 demonstrate the versatility of fuel use with the Direct FuelCell as well a s 20 its capability to produce more electricity than other technologies using th e 20 same quantity of fuel With 500 municipal waste water treatment systems in 20 the U S and a greater number of industrial wastewater treatment facilitie s 20 that produce sufficient gas to supply our fuel cell power plants we 20 anticipate that generation of electricity at wastewater treatment plants wi ll 20 be a significant market for FuelCell Energy 20 This is cutting edge technology that will help King County turn a waste 20 byproduct into a valuable resource said King County Executive Ron Sims 20 This is an important project as we look to meeting our future power needs in 20 this new era of higher priced electricity 20 A wastewater treatment system that uses an anaerobic digester process to 20 stabilize solids and reduce pathogenic microorganisms produces a methane ri ch 20 gas that can be fed to the DFC power plant According to industry sources a 20 30 mgd wastewater treatment plant generates sufficient digester gas to fuel a 20 one megawatt fuel cell power plant using carbonate technology 20 Gregory M Bush manager technology assessment and resource recovery at th e 20 Department of Natural Resources for King County said This is a very 20 exciting project for King County We are able to use a renewable gas resour ce 20 product in this case a by product of the wastewater treatment to produce 20 electricity to power our plant and achieve a higher value in the process We 20 acknowledge the vision of EPA in seeing that wastewater treatment plants ca n 20 contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas and air pollution 20 conventionally associated with electricity generation We re pleased to pla y 20 a part in validating digester fuel cell systems because of the environmenta l 20 benefits of producing power without combustion thereby reducing air 20 pollutants 20 Robert K Bastian senior environmental scientist for the EPA Office of 20 Wastewater Management commented Once able to operate on a sustainable 20 basis it appears that fuel cells have the potential to improve the 20 efficiency of energy recovery from digester gas while greatly reducing air 20 emissions including greenhouse gases from wastewater treatment plants 20 The 1MW Carbonate Fuel Cell demonstration project at King County provides a n 20 opportunity to show and document this potential improvement in energy 20 recovery and reduction in air emissions from the conversion of methane 20 produced by anaerobic sludge digestion to electrical power 20 FuelCell Energy s field trials are precursors to the DFC commercial market 20 entry Current field trials in operation or scheduled for 2001 include 250 kW 20 DFC power plants at the University of Bielefeld and the Rhone Klinikum 20 Hospital in Germany at the headquarters of the Los Angeles Department of 20 Water and Power a 250 kW system in Japan for Marubeni and a 250 kW unit 20 slated for the spring of 2001 at Mercedes Benz U S International in 20 Tuscaloosa Alabama Also slated for 2001 is a 3 kW DFC unit for the U S 20 Coast Guard at the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia to demonstrate fuel ce ll 20 capabilities at remote sites Discussions are underway with PPL EnergyPlus 20 regarding site location for their first order of a 250 kW unit to be shippe d 20 later this year 20 About Direct FuelCell R Technology 20 The growing demand in both private and public sectors for clean efficient 20 power in the US and around the world is driving interest in fuel cell 20 technology FuelCell Energy s DFC R

observations of the GE contract I tried to confine it to significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along General Terms and Conditions I don t see where the buyer has much financial leverage for performance warranty issues Final payment is made at shipment with the Buyer having the benefit of a 10 retention bond however the retention bond expires at Provisional Acceptance There is no financial leverage for Final Acceptance or the warranty period Also usually provisional or final acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals The assignment language 8 is somewhat narrow I don t know the deal so I don t know how it fits It can help to have language which allows for free assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full whichever occurs first Also the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment security in lieu of the buyer guaranty Again I don t know the deal so this may be fine as is The contract incorporates GE s proposal as a part of the contract but does not give an order of precedence I haven t seen the proposal or any other technical exhibits but sometimes these can be very self serving Therefore you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit Warranty The language is a bit confusing to me especially the interplay of the 1st and 2nd paragraph Also the outs they have are very broad It is better if there outs are limited to installation operation maintenance not in accoredance with their written instructions alternatively industry practice Also they have an out if repairs are performed without their permission but there s no time line or urgency for their response to a warranty claim A statement that they must provide a service engineer within 3 days or so might help I also suggest being clear that 1 2 applies to warranty obligations but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty problems need to be explicit Excusable Delay 15 I would delete indirectly from the 3rd line Provisional Acceptance I don t understand the phrase only to the extent and proportional share Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full LD s or that the buyer has to prove a right to collect LD s Litigation The dispute resolution mediation then litigation is not consistent with the usual arbitration route we request I didn t take a hard look at LD s since I assumed these are settled 13 6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this For instance I would delete or clarify the phrase including that due to environment or operation as being vague 13 6 i The phrase proper storage installation operation and maintenance should be as defined by GE s written instructions or at least based on industry standards 13 6 ii could conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair then not allow us to get someone else to do the work 14 1 The last line should include the words strict liability after negligence GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they introduce This is a quick look If you need more detailed information and you think there s time to negotiate further I can look at it in more detail Kay Bob Licato Bob Licato enron com

confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction However the confidential information disclosed under these particular agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual relationship The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate s and PMW s rights under the

Agreement 2VCP02 DOC 2VCPRED DOC Carlos We have enclosed the initial draft of a Purchase Agreement pertaining to Kendall New Century Development LLC Also enclosed is a blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions to the form of agreement initially furnished to us We are continuing to review the Purchase Agreement and may wish to suggest additional revisions however we have attempted to expedite the review process by circulate a draft today We wish to call to your intention several matters which may warrant further consideration 1 Please advise whether Enron has any outstanding guaranties or performance bond type obligations in connection with the Kendall Project If so we will want to add appropriate provisions addressing the replacement of such guaranties and or performance bonds by the Purchaser 2 We anticipate that the Purchaser will require some type of representation as to balance sheet information i e a description or listing of assets and liabilities of the Company We have not yet drafted this representation as it would be helpful to know what type of information is available and what type of representation Enron is willing to make in this regard 3 The first sentence in Section 6 3 the covenant pertaining to Project Obligations seems rather unusual as it is more typical for the Seller to be subject to such restrictions rather than the Purchaser However since it appears to have been deliberately drafted in this manner we have not attempted to revise this provision and we await guidance on whether revision would be acceptable to Enron Please review the enclosed and advise of any comments or questions In the meantime if we may be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call Thank you Carolyn M Campbell King Spalding 713 276 7307 phone

with affiliates since we rely on them to support a large portion of our business Secondly I need your legal opinion as to the realistic enforceability of such an agreement and what form that enforcement might take or whether the CA only serves as a scare tactic The reason being there is a Peoples employee that I think is in the process of looking for another job He is also the one that I am most concerned about sharing confidential information Therefore I am hoping to force his hand and see his reaction to the CA Kay has a large amount of history with our business and other CA s that

the Kendall LLC and Titan LLC projects Under ComEd s tariff we have 90 days to execute the IA in order to maintain our position s in ComEd s interconnection queue I have told ComEd that we would likely modify their boilerplate IA to make it resemble the IA signed by ENA and ComEd in Q2 2000 on the Des Plaines LLC project in Will County Illinois My preference would be to wait a few weeks on starting negotiations on either IA so that we can attempt to finalize a sale of member interests with either PSEG or Entergy If you would like to see the ComEd boilerplate IA let me know and I will

Subject PSEG Request Kay I talked with PSEG this morning PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA The specifics of this LOI are PSEG would pay an up front 300 000 payment to ENA This payment would be non refundable unless PSEG discovered a fatal flaw in the project we will have to carefully define this concept The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or PSEG would forfeit the up front payment The 2 7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing signing the SPA and transferring the member interests I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC with another Buyer before they get their act together

Highlander is longer taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus Despite its greater size the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300 so acceleration should equal or better its

outdoorsy image the interior has always been comfortable enough for the dilettante woodsman who doesn t like to get his nails too dirty Though the old 3 3 liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low end grunt the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked against newer competitors So revel all you who seek liberation from urban ennui the Pathfinder is finally energized by a stouter V6 based on the Maxima sedan s stellar powerplant When mated to a five speed manual transmission the 3 5 liter DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot pounds of torque Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25 foot pounds of twist still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go mountain climbing as well as merge onto freeways without fear The Pathfinder comes with rear wheel or part time four wheel drive the latter of which provides a shift on the fly transfer case that can be engaged at speeds up to 50 mph On LE models an automatic All Mode four wheel drive system can be specified for 2001 giving you one more reason to skip paying the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands All Mode operates in 2WD automatic 4WD 4WD Hi and 4WD Lo all selected using a simple rotary knob on the dashboard We ve long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling further enhanced by solid unibody construction The interior one of the friendliest of any SUV on the market is spruced up for 2001 with an updated instrument panel A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 12 volt power source will organize all your gewgaws You can choose from three trim levels the XE which for the 2001 model year comes with standard power windows mirrors and locks and a security system the sporty SE which gives you a choice of automatic or manual transmission along with sporty trim and the top of the line LE which includes fog lights Bose audio system and fake wood accents All models come standard with 16 inch wheels full size spare tire a CD player and ABS Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in leather wrapped seating which is available only on SE and LE Those same models when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic transmission can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system which includes a 6 4 inch flip down LCD screen video player and ports to plug and play a PlayStation 2 And we all know how important that will be after Christmas don t we A Birdview navigation system shared with the Infiniti QX4 is also available but we don t recommend it While the

substantial maximum cargo carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet surprising for what appears to be a relatively small vehicle Some of this space in our humble opinion should have been used to alleviate

Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle The problem was Ford s Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and in some cases was even more expensive For 2002 Mercury has attempted to further distinguish their sport ute from the popular Explorer The result is a fine SUV with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content This near luxury sport ute comes with either a 4 0 liter V6 making 210 horsepower or a 4 6 liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies Both engines come mated to a five speed automatic transmission The new V8 offers copious and refined power delivery but unimpressive mileage numbers Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out and the results are pleasing Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A pillars forward its New Edge theme makes use of a satin finish grille and bold headlamps Meanwhile the interior gets satin aluminum trim accents lending a distinctive high tech flavor to this former Explorer clone Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic however An all new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole in frame design debuts this year This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches thereby making room for a third row seat while increasing ground clearance to 9 2 inches At the same time ride and handling have been dramatically improved The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering characteristics A 2 5 inch wider stance improves handling even more while increasing interior room Noise vibration and harshness NVH have also been improved in the 2002 Mountaineer A 50 percent reduction of air leakage into the truck s cabin and a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment although some vibration from the available all wheel drive system does intrude through the floor New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six way power adjustable driver s seat along with optional adjustable pedals heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors Among the Mountaineer s new safety features are optional side curtain airbags a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles Later in the model year rollover protection sensors and a new AdvanceTrac traction stability control system will also be available The Mountaineer s strengths lie in its feature content powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension There are plenty of SUVs on the market but if you want an Explorer yet can t stomach the thought of owning the golden retriever of sport

Jacoby HOU ECT ECT Subject Pontiac Land Option Our current land option on the Pontiac site goes to June 11th with a 6 month extension for 5000 In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site we re trying to sell it now I have gotten Ben s authorization to secure an additional 12 month extension on the deal for 10 000 I spoke to the landowner Dick Greene and he indicated that they would consider it although he has never been in favor of an option structure since he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale The concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension and give them an additional 5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month extension on the back At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we would pay them another 5000 He said he would have to hear what his lawyer said in this regard but I think its close to a deal Perhaps we could arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper Rudnick as she has dealt extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner Its good timing to hit him now since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly As regards accounting issues the total exercise price is 117 acres 4500 ac 526 500 and 5 26 325 Total option premiums including this extension I am proposing will be 20 000 I believe we may also need to amend the original option language to make it clear that the option

CCampbell KSLAW com on 03 01 2001 02 07 06 PM To kay mann enron com kay mann enron com cc Keffer John JKeffer KSLAW com Subject FW Form for Blue Dog Kay I have a few minor comments to the new draft of the LLC Letter Agreement 1 Section 2 The new draft provides for closing no later than 10 business days after funding the escrow while the old draft provided for closing on the 7th business day after funding the escrow I have a recollection that ENA actually needed the 7 business days and no less thus the requirement of ON the 7th business day in order to prepare for closing and was trying to avoid the possibility of the counterparty wanting to close before ENA could complete the matters required of it to properly effect a transfer If the timing on this is not sensitive the new draft is fine 2 Section 5 a The new draft provides that ENA is responsible for any increase in the Purchase Amount if the increase is caused by ENA s acts or omissions The new draft does not mention the base amount or point of reference any increase over which would thus be ENA s responsibility The old draft provided that ENA was responsible for the Purchase Amount as determined on the basis of facts and circumstances existing prior to closing 3 Section 9 a xiv It appears that a verb is missing from this sentence 4 Section 19 c I think the definition of Commercial Operation can be deleted since the only place it appears is in Section 19 g where it is used with the parenthetical as defined in the Turbine Contract However we need to confirm that commercial operation is actually defined in the Turbine Contract as I believe this was the transaction where the term was constantly used in the underlying agreement without definition 5 Section 19 g In the definition of Take Over replace both references to Unit with references to the GE Equipment Please call if you want to discuss these comments Thank you Carolyn M Campbell King Spalding 713 276 7307 phone 713 751 3280 fax ccampbell kslaw

Paige should have received a rejection letter and a hold letter The rejection letter was from her submittal to the analyst process on her own The hold letter supposedly says that based on referrals she is on a waiting list and will be contacted for interviews provided there is any space left in the summer analyst class Basically they have offers out to what they call first tier schools and are waiting for responses If they have any spots left they will interview any candidates that are on hold based on resume review I asked why she didn t merit an interview right out of the gate and she told me it was because she was from a smaller school where we don t normally recruit and she lacked experience in Enron industries sounded like a canned answer to me Will you check with Paige and see if she did get this hold letter I want to push to at least get her an interview but am sensitive to making too big a deal about it and hurting her chances more than helping them I ll also talk to

the better taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up Someone needs to name it We should also look at a minimal list of officers 4 I don t have the attachment in front of me so I will have to look it up I ll get back to you The concept is that ENA is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date I thought the language was awkward and tried

agenda item that will go on the Commission s Open Agenda Conference for approval to establish the procedural schedule for the CPCN application intervention dates intervenor testimony rebuttal testimony etc Although he wanted to schedule the evidentiary hearing for the last week in September the Commisssion s calendar is currently full So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday October 2 The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed orders I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the third week in September One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment I am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule on the Commission s July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can start to run August 7 That action along with scheduling the hearing for the third week in September will make it far more likely than not that the CPCN will issue before November 1 Failing that we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or preferably two weeks It will not be difficult to do that if there are no intervenors or if the intervenors do not object Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item

recourse is limited to the Delta Affiliate that defaulted on the GE Change Order payment in the first place Delta Affiliate stops paying for the Insurance that the LLC must have Enron decides to make the Insurance payments and then must recover the costs from the Delta Affiliate Despite its representations Delta Affiliate has incurred a brokerage fee defaults in that payment Enron covers it and then must recover from Delta Affiliate Delta Affiliate incurs some third party personal injury liability and Enron becomes liable for it and can seek recovery from the Delta Affiliate Delta Affiliate breaches the agreement and Enron seeks damages which are limited to what it can recover only from the Delta Affiliate As a compromise there could be a monetary cap on the guaranty that it be tied to

Attention Benjamin F Jacoby Executive Director Re Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines Ladies and Gentlemen Pursuant to our discussions last week the following summarizes the main 20 commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation 01 NorthWestern 01 8 and 20 Enron North America Corp ENA regarding NorthWestern 01 s purchase thro ugh 20 the LLC referred to below or as otherwise accomplished without violation of 20 the Turbine Contract referred to below the 01 Purchase 018 of two 2 Ge neral 20 Electric 01 GE 018 7EA combustion turbines the 01 Turbines 018 the f irst of which 20 is presently located at a GE storage facility and the second of which is 20 scheduled to be available for delivery in February 2002 and both of which 20 are subject to purchase from GE under an agreement with GE dated as of May 20 31 2000 the 01 Turbine Contract 018 with respect to which ENA has the r ight to 20 cause a joint venture limited liability company in which prior to commerci al 20 operation of the Turbines ENA holds a 20 equity interest and a wholly own ed 20 NorthWestern subsidiary the 01 NorthWestern Subsidiary 018 holds an 80 equity 20 interest the 01 LLC 018 to become the purchaser 1 Purchase Price NorthWestern will pay ENA 48 0 million for the Turbin es 20 subject to adjustment as described below Adjusted how Need specific 20 reference Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent 20 with the structure Definitely sounds like a UCC deal for what that 01 s 20 worth 2 Closing Date of Purchase The Purchase will close on a date on or prio r 20 to September 1 2001 as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days 01 20 written notice to ENA provided that such notice may not be given less than 20 30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the 20 Purchase What happens at closing Payment of the balance In the 20 interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a 20 certain manner Are we taking on implied obligations to NW 3 Cash Down Payment NorthWestern will pay ENA an 8 0 million down 20 payment for the Turbines The first installment 3 0 million of the 8 0 20 million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement 20 with ENA providing for the Purchase The second installment 5 0 million 20 of the 8 0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of i closing of 20 the Purchase or ii July 15 2001 The remaining 40m due at closing as 20 well as any other amounts due to changes etc 4 Liquidated Damages If prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra ct 20 is proper reference to closing the purchaser under the Turbine Contract 20 receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract then ENA will 20 give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible Then what 5 Carry Period ENA will provide an interest free carry on the unpaid 20 purchase price of the Turbines until July 15 2001 If the closing of the 20 Purchase occurs after July 15 2001 then the unpaid purchase price of the 20 Turbines will be increased by interest at the rate of 7 5 per annum on the 20 unpaid purchase price of the Turbines 40 0 million for each day from an d 20 including July 15 2001 to but excluding the closing date 6 Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2 ENA will not proceed with this change 20 order to effect the conversion Instead it will be the responsibility of 20 NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE does this mean they will 20 be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser Are we 20 committing to pay for the increase Does the purchase price increase Is 20 there a limit 7 Unpaid Price of Second Turbine At the time of closing one or more 20 installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to 20 GE under the Turbine Contract the 01 Unpaid Installments 018 ENA will be 20 obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the 20 Turbine Contract 20 8 Guarantees There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of 20 the representations warranties covenants indemnities or other obligation s 20 of ENA in connection with the Purchase All obligations of the LLC under t he 20 Turbine Contract as well as all obligations of the NorthWestern Subsidiary 20 to ENA in connection with the transaction will be guaranteed by NorthWeste rn 20 Corporation governing law Limit on remedies damages for this letter Dispute resoluti on NorthWestern and ENA have acknowledged that subject to review and approval 20 of the structure of the Purchase and the negotiation of final documentation 20 relating to the Purchase which documentation will incorporate the commerci al 20 terms set forth above the above commercial terms have received all 20 necessary NorthWestern and ENA internal approvals Is this true for Enron 20 In light of this acknowledgement NorthWestern and ENA by signing this 20 letter in the space provided below and returning the same to NorthWestern 20 agree to negotiate in good faith to agree upon such structure and such 20 documentation with a view to executing and delivering a mutually acceptabl e 20 definitive agreement relating to the Purchase as promptly as practicable F or 20 the avoidance of any doubt it is expressly stated acknowledged and agreed 20 that each of NorthWestern and ENA must be satisfied

that we or other parties would require before splitting proceeds Can you find out what document they will need to produce to our satisfaction so that we don t breach the deal by splitting the check I guess we could write out two checks and make them out to Hillary AND Luke so they both have to cosign and can each deposit one check in their respective accounts As to sending the option renewal check out with the Greene document I think that it would be better to send it along with the other 5000 check so they get more money in one instance I think my suggested cover letter said that How much

Memorandum of Options for all option agreements The Greene Amendment to Option and Amended Short Form of Option have been approved by Carlos but not yet forwarded to the Greenes or their attorney It was my understanding that you wanted to send the Option renewal premium at the same time we sent the proposed agreements Is that still the case With regards to the Fehr Memorandum it is true that Karen way did not prepare a Memorandum for this Option but I think I have a draft of one for them We definately need to get this taken care of and have the Fehr s execute it and get it recorded We need to send them an option payment by April 2 so we can send the Memorandum at that time Can you please find out if we should issue separate checks for the Fehrs Kathleen Rusty Stevens 03 23 2001 12

today and among other things we discussed I mentioned that we were working on the Greene option agreement extension What is the status of the extension Secondly I mentioned to Mark that I had heard from Hillary Fehr and she indicated that she and Luke were no longer married She wanted to know what we needed from her in that regard I told her to send us a brief letter stating that and to ask that we send her a copy of any notices of exercise of option or whatever at her dad s address Apparently the plan is to have Luke continue to reside in the house in the interim but she said for now I let her know that our option agreement precluded their selling the house and that it would be to their disadvantage to give up the potential upside anyway Mark pointed out that we need to make sure we have recorded Memorandum of Option Agreements for all of our agreements particularly this one so they dont try to sell anyway and have a lender do a title search and not find out that the property was encumbered with our option agreement I understood that we had not done memorandums for all of the parcels under option and would appreciate an update and plan of attack to get them in place Thanks

breathes Bless her heart I know how she feels Well you won t be moving until I get back so it ll be interesting to see what happens I wonder if you ll get a promotion I bet women problems won t even phase Ben but maybe we can always hope Usually you say female problems and the men run the opposite direction I just got finished paying bills Boy do I have a lot of them I m anxious to be able to go to the Astros game We have tickets for this coming weekend but I won t be able to go I can t remember when our next regular season tickets are since I don t have my calendar in front of me I m going to venture out to get my nails done today drive I feel pretty good so it should be ok I m sure I am going to be SO READY to come back to work I m so glad I have email so I can keep in touch every day

Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave me alone I figure if that doesn t do it nothing will Neil gets to go with me which is really nice It is a 4 o clock game which I think is a neat time Daylight savings time starts next week so I guess the sun will be setting as the game ends I m glad baseball season is back although I did gave away our tickets to tomorrow s game Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the hospital so she could be induced Texas Women s was too busy to take them They finally called them in at 700

splitting the HSR fee with Enron bearing a maximum of 25k Bill Blumenthal our HSR expert has now spoken with Dave Burns Paul Hastings HSR expert and Bill reports back that Mr Burns now agrees that there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the put call Apparently Mr Burns had not previously focused on the transfer of the remaining 20 interest in the LLC pursuant to the put call in his analysis They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the following alternatives 1 Straight up 50 50 split of fees with no 25k maximum on Enron s contribution so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the fee or 2 Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some structure such that upon exercise of the put call the value of the assets owned by the LLC are as low as possible This may involve transferring one or more of the turbines to another LLC wholly owned by the LLC Greg thinks that the value of the assets of wholly owned subsidiaries need not be included in the threshold calculation but I have not confirmed this I indicated that this could be viewed by the FTC as a subterfuge for avoiding filing requirements He called back and subsequently advised that the solution may then involve transferring

commercially reasonable efforts to execute an escrow agreement on or before April 16 2001 3 The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of a ENA s delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and b the closing of PPL s financing 4 ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19 2001 but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business day beyond April 11 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract 5 The closing occurs at least 5 but not later than 10 business days after funding the escrow account 6 Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before May 3 2001 If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11 2001 then the April 19 2001 right to terminate stands PPL s obligation to fund the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing Greg Lang advises that they are working on PPL s financing but he did not give an estimated date for financial closing I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were causing heartburn He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker He asked today about GE s reaction to the consent document and if it would be appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point He also requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions When you get a chance please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for PPL s review Also we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form of escrow agreement and the anticipated disbursement instructions and to

Power Light Co said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp in a stock deal worth 7 billion to create the largest U S power generating company The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than 27 billion consisting of 16 4 billion in equity market capitalization and 10 7 billion in debt and preferred stock the companies said The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies Under the terms of the agreement FPL shareholders would receive one share of a new holding company for each FPL share held Entergy shareholders would get 0 585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share Based on the companies closing stock prices the deal would value Entergy at its market value of 7 billion or about 30 89 per share FPL shares closed Friday at 52 13 16 off a year high of 56 5 8 but up from a low of 36 3 8 Entergy stock ended at 30 5 16 off a high of 31 3 16 but up from a low of 15 15 16 SHAREHOLDERS APPROVAL REQUIRED The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 15 months The merger combines two strategically aligned financially healthy companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry said J Wayne Leonard Entergy chief executive Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company while FPL s chief executive James Broadhead will serve as chairman The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57 percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of directors the companies said Once combined the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of 110 million to 150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue enhancements of 40 million to 125 million and capital expenditure savings of 50 million to 100 million the companies said FPL and Entergy said they will seek to minimize workforce effects of the merger through a variety of unidentified efforts In addition both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans together worth 1 billion FPL plans to repurchase 570 million shares while Entergy is looking to buy back 430 million in stock the companies said

URGENT STOP PAYMENT Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served on EECC on April 10 EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial District Court of Harris County in connection with a judgment against certain CIGSA entities In the writ the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from the court The writ was issued to enforce an judgment for 1 3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any that might have such funds or assets The lawyer for Mr Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment In the meantime effective immediately do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of or release ANY property to or on behalf of any CIGSA entity without first

consent They want to be able to exercise their call or take an assignment of the turbine contract earlier They are willing to take the risk with the GE warranties This is a relationship issue It is also their biggest issue On an interesting note Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer of all the equipment to Sweetgum Do you know if Lee knows about this Ciao Kay

the jursidiction clause that would have us consent to either NY state or federal court you had revised the document to only have NY federal courts apply but the Lenders have responded that they need the state court reference in the event that the federal courts will not take the case Attached is the redline to show how the clause has been revised to eliminate the waiver of forum non conveniens and how the jurisidiction will only apply to the consent agreement but I d like your approval to accept NY state court as well In the alternative Lender s counsel has commented that in another Enron

to be signed by Salmon we would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions ratifying and approving the security agreement rather than have ENA approve a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with From a timing standpoint we need to focus on the documentation required to set up the escrow account as I understand that the escrow may be funded

enronXgate Subject Re Who delivers LM6000s from GE Facility to Site 1 0 John A and Armando My question and John s response has led me down the following merry chase The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to the Delivery Point The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port Without any other documents GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is Brazilian Trust s I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage but there are some storage costs Note We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a dispute at hand I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the equipment until we take it out of storage As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is as follows GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to Brazilian Trust Brazilian Trust delivers to the port and keeps risk of loss until Ex Terra at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase Agreement transfers to NEPCO but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of loss at ExTerra Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC contract and is protected by clause 8 1 of the EPC Contract Under what authority is NEPCO transporting the equipment from the GE delivery point to Exterra has Brazilian Trust engaged NEPCO to do so The Turbine Purchase Agreement does not contemplate this 2 0 David Gohlke I think we have a small hole that needs and can be easily filled In the Turbine Purchase Agreement can we have NEPCO perform transport service from the GE delivery point to Exterra but BT keeps ROL 3 0 I think from a GE perspective the Enron family takes ROL from GE at Jacinto port and gets the turbines delivered to the Site 4 0 Kay Mann I really need a

being the Fuel Manager this is a retrade How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary services get accounted for in the cost calculation How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit or a cost Regarding calculation of the Bogey we have several issues First what is the methodology Rick is very close to having a stack model that incorporates the business rules including minimum run times startup costs VOM etc Second what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for running the model This process will need to be documented every time the calc is performed Third what is the timing of the calc We discussed getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a day ahead basis Only on a select basis would the calc be re done mid day We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on these issues This should result in a set of business rules that can be put into the contract Please comment correct add

services deals and I think the following is the way to handle it We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time chose to transact directly with a third counterparty We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc for them if they chose to do this In this way the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else Tom Kay Mann 05

given a certain gas price Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager this is a retrade How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary services get accounted for in the cost calculation How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit or a cost Regarding calculation of the Bogey we have several issues First what is the methodology Rick is very close to having a stack model that incorporates the business rules including minimum run times startup costs VOM etc Second what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for running the model This process will need to be documented every time the calc is performed Third what is the timing of the calc We discussed getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a day ahead basis Only on a select basis would the calc be re done mid day We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on these issues This should result in a set of business rules

I m OK with proceeding if everyone thinks we can resolve some stuff John G Rigby ENRON DEVELOPMENT 05 15 2001 03 03 PM To Kay Mann Corp Enron Enron Scott Dieball ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Sheila Tweed HOU ECT ECT Ed B Hearn III HOU ECT ECT pthompson akllp com cc John Schwartzenburg ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Scott Dieball ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Subject World Hunger Rev 4a JR I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call Status as follows a Tax language I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep Steve Swifit and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call b Insurance Language review I sent same version to David Marshall and Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA s are new technology c I volunteered to look at the termination language in world hunger GE had some problems and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract I drafted a fix last Friday sent to Kay M for comment I have included my suggested changes in the attached redline I have forwarded same fix to GE at end Friday for Arcos I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination I think it works d I volunteered to work over Article 10 Exhibit B 3 and Exhibit B 6 in relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages I have done that in the attached redline of the T C and Exhibits e Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the reduction in the LD refund in Section 10 9 8 I had sent out a couple weeks ago but received no reaction I have entered that fix in the attached redline f I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with performance Attached is Rev4 JR version of GE T C s and Exhibits for world hunger They start from the clean rev 4 version of the T Cs that Peter forwarded to me at my request The attached are redlined to show my changes I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger call I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there is an objection I hope this will help to advance the process My earlier emails to Paul and Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts Please ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files Kay I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday ","message_subject":"Re: World

Knight Ridder Tribune Business News KRTBN Copyright C 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go ahead to expand its Moss Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant The four signed an agreement not to participate in any lawsuit or regulatory challenge that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession 1 million from Duke for environmental monitoring and research Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult But today as power starved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development Environmentalists who signed the agreement though said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion they had little chance of stopping it especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board So they took the potentially controversial step entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant s impact on the marine environment Other environmentalists though criticized that approach Duke Energy s efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups including 7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant s use of seawater 425 000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean 1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores the Center for Marine Conservation the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project 100 000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property 3 4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community 100 000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing 60 000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail If approved Duke would provide an additional 250 000 endowment to maintain the trail It is very disheartening said Carolyn Nielson a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system These environmental groups have the expertise the biologists the attorneys said Nielson who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board We could have been much more successful with their help But there wouldn t have been any financial reward in it for them Such criticisms are off base according to Warner Chabot regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate Look at what s happening with power plant approvals in California right now said Chabot referring to the state s push to bring new energy sources on line The Moss Landing project which is scheduled to add 1 060 megawatts in 2002 enough to serve one million homes is a key part of that energy expansion plan No money will go to the four environmental groups the Center for Marine Conservation along with Save Our Shores Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project It will be routed in five yearly installments of 200 000 each to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs including scientific research Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board He said the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey Bay Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation he said Not a penny comes to me Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people It s a million dollars worth of water quality studies said Duke spokesman Tom Williams Our whole effort wasn t to try to buy anybody off It was designed to help increase people s comfort level where there wasn t a comfort level The 1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than 12 million in Duke payments to civil government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization The heftiest award 7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation a nonprofit environmental organization was negotiated by state agencies to mitigate environmental impacts of the plant Formed in 1982 the slough foundation exists to promote the wise use and conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands its Web site says However some environmentalists say the state approved mitigation plan is inadequate If you want to say Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money I would say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board for the price of mitigation Chabot said The agencies got bought off cheap And the environment got taken to the cleaners Duke s Williams strongly disagreed Environmental mitigation must be based on science not on buying anybody off he said That is inappropriate and we would not participate in that That suggestion is offensive to us And it should be offensive to any environmentalist Bob Haussler head of the Energy Commission s environmental protection office said the mitigation plan is biologically sound We are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem he said Madeline Clark a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects called the recipients of Duke s payments a shopping list of government agencies environmental groups and civic organizations She was particularly critical of the 1 million deal with environmental groups You know what bothers me Clark said Environmental groups get tons of donations Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment If a big corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off I have a real problem with that Construction began in November on Duke s project to add 1 060 megawatts of natural gas fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant purchased from PG E in 1998 If the expansion is finished next year as scheduled it would account for more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002 This is a big deal said Williams the Duke spokesman It will be the largest plant in California If that plant is delayed a month or two we lose the summer of 2002 And that affects not only Duke Energy but the state of California Opponents say it s not the power they oppose but the plant s cooling system which will pump about 1 2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor Such pumping they say will degrade Elkhorn Slough They argue for an alternative cooling system such as towers that re circulate water Basically what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the harbor and slough run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead said Steve Shimek executive director of the Otter Project For Shimek and other environmentalists scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plant s impact on the environment There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment said Vicki Nichols executive director of Save Our Shores We felt we didn t have strong standing to sue Instead the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project The process gave me tremendous pause and great concern Nichols said I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing She was right As far as I m concerned with the price gouging going on by the energy wholesalers they are just receiving stolen goods said Clark of the citizens group Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator Chabot with the Center for Marine Conservation discouraged any comparison between the two offers calling it grossly unfair and inaccurate Regardless of what was intended with the payments Nielson said they stain the process It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical she said Shimek took a different view We convinced Duke to spend 1 million toward monitoring that frankly five years from now could very well come back to haunt them he said Did we do the right thing I have no idea Did we try our best Yes we did ","message_subject":"Wonder if its off the balance

com cc Fine Jonathan JFine kilstock com Subject NCNG Delivery Points There would seem to me to be two questions the threshold one is whether the site is within Rocky Mount s service territory If it is then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point I haven t reviewed the annexation statutes yet but based on my initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount and NCNG once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount s purview to serve and although a mutually agreeable delivery point would have to be negotiated NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith The January 13 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city s incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the aforementioned area presumably referring to the annexed area although the agreement is not a model of clarity So at least based on this language Rocky Mount s right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits whatever they might be Jonathan and I are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there The 1992 Service agreement provides In Article IV provides that points of devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement with NCNG shall be at the following locations and other stations added at mutually agreeable locations in the future In the Third Amendment to the Natural Gas Service Agreement dated March 10 1997 new language and delivery points are negotiated upon but the principle is still included that other stations may be added at mutually agreeable locations in the future The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to give in exchange In the 1997 agreement Rocky Mount agreed to an extention of terms of the of ten years until December 6 ","message_subject":"Re: NCNG Delivery Points","recipient_count":"1","received_time":"2000-08-09

respect clients will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory paragraph and the signature block Indeed as a side note most of the documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for subsequent references to Enron I am indifferent but I know that the reason our accounting brethen made that comment as well as the other comments they often make that seem counter intuitive is that it facilitates their efforts in ensuring that documents reflect off balance sheet soft costs related rather than on balance sheet hard costs As such I would defer to them on this issue which was in response to Carlos with all due respect to our Accounting brethren from a commercial point of view potential clients don t want to do business with EDM they want to do business with Enron So please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine Anyway I think Herman must have forwarded copy of those emails to Lisa who shared it with Joe Deffner

inadvertently ended the sentence with a comma The point I was making was that if it were necessary to negotiate an additional delivery point NCNG would probably demand concessions such as an extension of the contract period Hopefully since we are only talking about a high pressure tap NCNG will have less leverage Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago he expressed the concern that the description of the generators might be misleading unless either more or less data were supplied and he suggested describing them more generally I think he was confortable with the fact that the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand the generators described without the elaboration he thought necessary One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the risk that the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention etc accordingly If you want to revise the description of the equipment it would be less dangerous to file a

com on 08 28 2000 09 10 10 AM To gregg penman enron com cc kay mann enron com Subject 7 101 Petition re Master Sales Agreement This message and any attachments are intended for the individual or entity named above If you are not the intended recipient please do not read copy use or disclose this communication to others also please notify the sender by replying to this message and then delete it from your system Thank you These are my comments re the draft Petition forwarded by Peoples on Friday 1 The Petition describes PERC in paragraph and refers to PERC in par 3 PERC however is not a party to the Master Agreement and the Petition does not discuss request any relief with respect to PERC I don t see why there is a need to reference PERC 2 It is my understanding that under the Master Agreement there will be two types of transactions a simple buy sells at a clear market price and b complex transactions with sharing arrangements management fees and similar structures As we have discussed the first type of transaction simple buy sells at a market price fall under an exemption to Section 7 101 s approval requirement 220 ILCS 5 7 101 4 These types of transactions do not require ICC approval and MEH Peoples are free to engage in such transaction now I would suggest that the Petition point this out particularly if as I suspect is the case MEH and Peoples are now conducting such transactions or may wish to do so before the ICC acts on the Master Agreement Because the Master Agreement covers certain transaction which need approval and other which do not I would suggest that the Petition make this clear and request approval only to the extent required This was the language used by NIGAS in seeking approval of a buy sell agreement in Docket 95 0302 3 With respect to the transactions which do require approval the complex ones with sharing arrangements management fees and similar structures the draft Petition doesn t say much It says Par 5 that transactions under the Agreement will optimize the use of the gas supply and capacity assets of Peoples and MEH Par 9 that Peoples has similar master contracts with non affiliated entities par 10 that the agreement will not interfere with Peoples operations and par 10 that the Agreement is in the best interest of Peoples and its customers All of these statements are fine to include but the ICC is likely to want to know more about why the agreement is in the public interest Perhaps a sentence or two could explain how the Agreement will optimize Peoples use of its gas supply and capacity assets e g by using capacity which otherwise would be idle and how this will benefit Peoples Illinois ratepayers e g a credit to PGA gas costs Also Peoples is asking that the ICC pre approve an arrangement under which the details of individual transactions will be filled in later As I understand it the details will include such things as the level of management fees and other compensation terms To facilitate approval it would be best to have some sort of guideline to suggest to the ICC i e a management fee within a certain amount or percentage of a specified index level If there is an industry standard approach that could be referenced that may be of use The Petition suggests that there are other Agreements of this type with non affiliates Perhaps reference could be made to pricing provisions under one or more of those agreements If it is not possible to be any more specific I am concerned that the ICC may want to wait and review individual transaction rather than giving blanket approval without knowing more 4 The ICC approval process can take 4 5 months sometimes more to complete The required approval time however can be cut down significantly when the apprval filing includes a Peition and supporting testimony that lays out all the information needed to conclude that a proposed arrangement is in the public interest the interest of Illinois ratepayers The Petition itself need not include all the details it need only lay out the case ingeneral terms A filing package which with accompanying testimony tells the full story will expedite the approval process ","message_subject":"Re: 7-101

as our fee In consideration for this fee Enron takes the financial legal accounting and engineering lead Peoples and Enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week The basic goals are Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron Define financial arrangements cost profit Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary and covered by our confidentiality agreement Define term 5 years Each party bears their own internal costs and third party costs are split 50 50 with prior approval In that regard an immediate concern is getting the engineering work kicked off We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical

Enron cc Ben Jacoby HOU ECT ECT Laura Luce HOU ECT ECT Rusty Stevens Corp Enron ENRON Subject RE Torrence Cost Sharing Agreement Attached is the cost sharing agreement proposed by PERC on the Torrence site It proposes that ENA agree to share all future development costs and environmental liabilities on the Torrence parcel on a 50 50 basis I believe that there are some inconsistencies between the language in this Agreement and the PDA signed in April of 2000 i e dates terms and the members of the management committee I have informed PERC that it is ENA s policy not to step in the chain of title on properties with known environmental liabilities I have recommended to PERC that PGL Peoples regulated utility buy the Torrence property they want if for remediation purposes anyway from Air Liquide on June 26th and hold it while PERC and ENA complete the due diligence required to develop a commercially viable power plant development project It will be my recommendation that ENA does not execute this cost sharing agreement as written If the environmental liability risk was removed and stronger language inserted on the control of going forward development expenditures then it would represent a commercially reasonable agreement Ideally we would like this agreement to provide for ENA to market the Torrence and other development sites ENA s sell down strategy under a known value sharing formula and transaction financial triggers I will discuss this approach with Laura Luce and Curtis Cole this week From a legal perspective could we structure a long term lease between PGL and Torrence Power LLC PERC ENA as owners that could provide commercial site control to PERC ENA while leaving the environmental liabilities on the Torrence property with PGL this would be fitting because PGL has owned the property in the past and have likely been the major contributor to the site s environmental contamination Call me to discuss these issues Fred ","message_subject":"RE: Torrence Cost

Mail this article to a friend By James Covert Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow Jones Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations Enron Corp ENE news msgs will continue to develop and purchase power plants president Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation Skilling said responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the power generation business The Houston based energy company is absolutely not selling its power plants as part of its strategy he said Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas fired peaking plants which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices Skilling said Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U S Midwest and South and will continue development chiefly in the U S and Europe he said The margins are higher in wholesale power markets in Europe Skilling said The market there is more fractional and that creates more opportunities for someone who s playing across the board Developments in Europe particularly in southern Europe also offer a higher per unit rate of return Skilling said Nonetheless Skilling did confirm that the company isn t interested in building larger sized plants in any country and that its construction goals may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies We are not interested in building base load plants Skilling said referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities around the clock Base load simply delivers megawatts that s a bulky undifferentiated commodity Skilling said But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape of the market of that commodity Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron s future development plans saying that they weren t set in stone But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there are bottlenecks in the transmission system and that Enron isn t focused on any one geographic region as opposed to others There are companies out there saying they re going to build 40 000 megwawatts by such and such a date and I don t really see how that s possible Skilling said There are just too many variables to approach markets like that By James Covert Dow Jones Newswires 201 938 2061 james

article was originally published Monday WASHINGTON Dow Jones The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers but will act to overhaul the state s wholesale power markets if necessary FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U S West becomes available Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committee s energy panel If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told lawmakers And if price gouging is occurring as some have alleged he added we will respond accordingly by revoking market based rates or otherwise However Hoecker stressed that the commission s authority is limited under the Federal Power Act The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities Hoecker testified The commission can t act to limit prices charged by power providers until we have a record supporting such action he said referring to the results of the pending staff investigation Further he said the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas Electric Co for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee s Energy and Power Subcommittee which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC as SDG E a unit of Sempra Energy SRE news msgs sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the state sponsored electricity exchange and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state s independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California where price controls don t apply FERC hasn t yet responded to the producers and deferred action on SDG E s bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange Hoecker while withholding judgment pending the staff probe appeared to place much of the blame for this summer s crisis with the state mandated market structure which left San Diego consumers subject to spot market volatility And he appeared to suggest that FERC s order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations or RTOs will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the power supply problem FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited Hoecker said Other states such as Pennsylvania were less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate Hoecker noted Now with FERC s Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets he said Large regional markets can be made to work effectively Hoecker told the lawmakers citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state mandated market structure By requiring the state s three investor owned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into long term fixed price contracts the state left consumers subject to volatility in the state mandated spot market said officials with Enron Corp ENE news msgs and Reliant Energy REI news msgs California s market structure placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers Reliant s John Stout testified San Diego s experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation said Michael Shames executive director of Utility Consumer s Action Network Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that California s electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets California is just the latest problem area in U S power markets and unless policymakers act quickly it will not be the last said Enron Corp ENE news msgs Steven Kean executive vice president Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market said Edwin Guiles Sempra s president of regulated operations This electricity crisis is not a California only problem said Rep Brian Bilbray R Calif who represents San Diego and requested Monday s hearing We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don t work together to find long term solutions to the flaws in the marketplace Bilbray said By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires 202 862 6647 bryan lee dowjones com Quote for referenced ticker symbols EIX ENE PCG REI SRE 2000 Dow Jones

Fehr Option Agreement Kay We are in agreement on the x months date certain that the document needs to end I have suggested that we propose one year If we dont extend the deal for a second 18 month term this actually ends the deal before the 3 year overall contemplated date As to running it back through Accounting I had hoped that we could avoid that since its still not an obligation that we have except as a result of our actions to begin construction of a facility so as I see it there s no change from the previous structure its not a put its an automatic call If I haven t talked you into it yet and you feel it does need to go past accounting again please ask them to hurry since we have an incentive to get it done quickly I dont recall what the paragraph 5 changes were but we are in fact spending a lot of time with Karen at this time to get the zoning approved at Pontiac This is why we are in a hurry We have to go for our zoning hearing on October 5th and we know we are going to be asked about the two nearby houses Fehr and Ledford and we want to be able to stand up and say that we too were concerned about the impact on those residents and that we have negotiated for the purchase of those homes so disturbance will be minimized I also don t want Mr Ledford who just got back from vacation to go talk to the Fehr s in the next day or so and make them re think the deal we

means that the assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE contract I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify in Stan s absence Peggy is checking on this also 4 Parent guaranty GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty From a quick review of the draft contract it appears that a change in language will be necessary since the current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment to a certain class of assignees If I am correct then I suggest consider inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after execution of the

about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference Enron Chairman Ken Lay talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for bandwidth trading and broadband services Asked what kind of company Enron is Lay gave an answer that shows the recent expansion of the company s business strategy beyond energy Enron is still basically an energy and broadband company he said While energy is still the source of most of Enron s revenue Lay s answer underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth trading A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as saying that in a few years it could be making as much money from those areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses Enron plans to spend 600 million 650 million this year and about the same amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading Lay said It will spend more during that time if necessary In fact the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in emerging markets that aren t growing quickly enough to meet Enron s standards Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and bandwidth trading which are growing more quickly he said In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity Enron s 90 bandwidth deals put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area El Paso Energy Corp EPG news msgs officials have said they have done 5 10 bandwidth trades this year Companies like Williams Communications Group WCG news msgs won t talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a telecommunications network Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year Lay said Some of the fiber optic network will be lit or made operational this year with the rest to be lit later The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York Los Angeles Las Vegas and London Enron s current plans call for a total of 13 pooling points Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another facilitating bandwidth trading Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom carriers The deal is a 20 year exclusive worldwide deal with a potential contract value of more than 1 billion to Enron according to

whether parties to a contract governed by Virginia law may negotiate to limit their liability under such contract The answer is yes Because the parties within broad parameters can make just about whatever law they like so long as it doesn t violate public policy etc Virginia freely allows limitation of liability clauses Of course in the case of fraud or material misrepresentation in inducement etc no court would honor the clause but that circumstance does not apply to us Please let me know if you need anything further David D David Parr Jr Esq Bracewell Patterson L L P 2000 K Street NW

meaningful without listing the manufacturer i e ONSI would be a lot more money Hence I think that we have to reference the manufacturer 2 The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question In order to mark any 2000 income we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 In my opinion we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI Based on how CRRA reacts I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI 3 I expect at least one EPC contract per project We don t want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project Performance tests will either be

language as unnecessary The suggested lined out changes to Clause 6 is not acceptable to GE GE requires that the tie back to the notices provisions of the Contracts remain The other edits to this Clause are acceptable The suggested change to Clause 15 is not acceptable GE states that they wish to remain simplistic and firm in this document and that it should not reflect Enron s buisness arrangements such as the subsequent assignment to Mitsui GE wants to be sure the assignment language is not skirted If the ENA parent guarantee has not been provided by the time the Contracts are assigned to Mitsui the Assignment provisions of the Contracts allow for the replacement of the ENA obligation by other equivalent guarantees or assurances Additionally the ENA parent guarantee a guarantee substantially less than one provided by Enron Crop was originally to be provided as a condition precedent to execution of the Contracts but we talked them into a due date of 30 days later

steadily disappear All in all things could not have gone much better It was agreed at the hearing that Allyson and Giselle would file the order jointly on October 11 Allyson will prepare a draft of the order and deliver to us Friday She Giselle and Tom Chapman are working on the for any reason language They had not discussed the language you submitted last week Your language is where they will
