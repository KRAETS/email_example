able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate In other words the RR would be treated just like any other landowner If we did that Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war Since our lines cross or parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth that would be foolish I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was interested in

on line research on this last Sept turned up nothing on point The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I ll excerpt here In Maritimes Northeast Pipeline L L C 80 FERC P 61 346 1997 Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted Commission staff denied the blanket request but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut off dates FN29 in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive On the other hand Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public Generally the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities FN30 However in the instance case the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and thus evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services Therefore we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut off dates to be made public FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events FN30 See e g Colorado Interstate Gas Company 76 FERC P 61 291 1996 In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America 82 FERC P 61 037 1998 which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements In ANR Pipeline Co the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power Even where transportation competition exists that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases Just to make sure I found everything I ll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything From Drew Fossum 02

Pueblo I heard from Tino this afternoon and here s what s going on 1 Tino has been focused exclusively on right of way issues He s been flying around in helicopters etc and not worrying about much else They ve got environmental people already doing non field work on possible routes like checking for available turtle studies and cultural resource stuff Dennis has been focused on the political angles apparently and has purportedly gained some additional intelligence about PNM s effort to get DOE to re up their contract for a new two year term Tino says DOE told PNM to pound sand and will continue to take service under month to month rollover of the existing PNM DOE contract until some alternative i e Dennis comes along 2 Tino wants to get deeper into talking to us about possible deal structures very soon This topic includes at least three things 1 how to structure the ownership of the pipeline to maximize Enron and Dennis finincial upside 2 how to structure ownership of the power plant and related facilities to maximize Enron and Dennis financial upside while satisfying DOE on Indian ownership and 3 how to streamline the regulatory approval process An example of the concerns Tino and Dennis are focused on is if the pipeline has a regulated rate of return but the power plant has to share profit with the Tribe ownership entity where do we put the bulk of the return Also of concern is how we cut Dennis in on a slice of upside stock in Enron Profit sharing on the power plant or pipeline ownership entity Something else 3 What do the economics look like This is obviously a threshold question that we ought to be moving toward an answer on for ourselves even if we aren t in a position yet to share the information Specifically given what we know about the likely cost of the pipeline and the likely capital cost and heat rates of the turbines ENA has available and what we know about forward gas curves and what we know about how much power PNM supplies to DOE and at what rate from the document Tino gave us in KC and PNM s tariff do we think we can build this thing and beat PNM s current price to DOE Can we beat it by 10 Can we beat it by 10 and have enough to sweeten the deal for the Tribe partly because that would make it more attractive to DOE I suggested to Tino that he ought to put together a list of the issues that they are working on and that they think we should be working on and what the critical path issues and decisions are If we do the same then we d be in a position to get another meeting together and have a productive agenda and find out if this project has real potential or not Bottom line I think if our analysis of question 3 is that we can hit decent RAROC numbers and still undercut PNM s existing DOE contract and cut the Tribe in on a decent share of the power plant upside we ought to move forward aggressively DF ","sent_time":"2000-02-18

S Enron ENRON cc Subject Pueblo project I spoke to Dennis Langley yesterday about his ideas on the financial stake he is looking for in the project There are several items which will need to be included in our economic analysis as they will burden the project The conditions are as follows Dennis needs wants to recover the O M for his idea generating group which he estimates to be 2 to 3 million per year Share with Dennis a 50 50 split of any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of additional capacity sold to serve these markets A 50 50 split of any revenue received on the new line which is built The Native American tribe s will receive 25 of ownership in the assets and 25 of the cashflow stream after payout he mentioned something about an IRR of 8 being the threshold His general feeling was that the pipeline should be a 50 50 joint venture but the gas fired generation plant would be ours James will need to run the numbers but my uneducated guess says that if things were slim before these financial hits will certainly render the project uneconomic especially the 2 to 3 million year extra O M He did indicate that they are having very good conversations with the DOE and would expect to sign a contract in April I am somewhat puzzled by what he could commit to since he would have no idea what rates he could charge for the electricity or gas transportation I told Dennis we would follow up with him shortly In the meantime we will be working with Mark Baldwin to scope out the opportunities in New Mexico ","sent_time":"2000-03-07

due to cooler summer weather less a c in the south end of the system We obtained this advice yesterday from Gilbert for another report requirement Also the reference to approximately 17 000 mile

letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one day terms as the FTS 1 agreement renews but not beyond a specified date Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3 month term I see no basis for this limitation The term of the FTS 1 agreement is one day renewable from day to day The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS 1 agreement renews If the FTS 1 agreement does not renew the discount is no longer applicable The basis for the shipper s transportation rights is the FTS 1 agreement We are not guaranteeing a shipper daily firm for longer than a one day term The discount letter merely states that for so long as the FTS 1 agreement renews a particular discount applies up to a certain cutoff

Subject Re holding capacity on PNM Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in order to make this filing While it is true that one of the reasons FERC rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on unspecified pipelines was because it was too general the Commission never stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the Texas Eastern requirements I believe that the filing is specific enough to address the Commission s concerns because we have narrowed it down to a specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a constraint on TW s system The Commission did not require us to have an agreement with PG E for Market Center services and in fact we did not have a deal in place when we made our filing While I m sure it s true that having a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing the Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully employed in our Market Center services filing On the

pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant At most we could assume maybe 5 000 10 000 day of gas load from industrials near the airport and another X 000 from Kirtland s gas load This assumed load will ramp up over several years or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are and not be available immediately 2 We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE Its probably 0 042 KWh less 15 20 to make it attractive or maybe 0 056 less 15 20 Either way a low rate 3 We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline about 17 mm in the 16 configuration without the Isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant Maybe about 20mm total 4 We don t have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to Palo Verde so I d suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at Palo Verde Are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing Ercot Pub Serv Colorado 5 I m not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics but to my non business guy mind the following scenarios or something similar stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense A Worst Case Assume we build a 75 mw power plant i e assume no extra power to sell in spot market and assume we get the Kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers Baldwin talked to If the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that Enron could live with based on our internal hurdle rates can we hit the DOE target power price and have any left over I suspect this scenario is upside down Should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant combined cycle and simple cycle B Mid Case Assume we size the power plant at 150mw or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense and that we sell the surplus power at Palo Verde prices less Albequerque Palo Verde transmission costs Again assume no incremental gas load except Kirtland If the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate Enron can live with does the power plant make enough to make the project work C Wildly Optimistic Case Same as mid case except add Baldwin s gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when NM gas restructuring kicks in in 2003 did I get the year right Also start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the Palo Verde spot sales at whatever year NM retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in also 2003 I think With optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense Tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of May Ideally we ll have a feel for the above relationships and the transmission constraint situation by then Thanks DF ","sent_time":"2000-04-11

along with a power price that is lower than DOE s current PNM rates will satisfy the public interest standard Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall structure of Dennis

Richardson on board but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people what a great deal this is for the Tribes and therefore the government Tino not surprisingly is eager to

total electric and gas load current and projected for the AFB and Sandia and 2 actual price DOE currently pays for gas and power He didn t think he could get better information before the first week

opportunities for a generation project in the Albuquerque region and he offered the following observations First he indicated ENA has evaluated numerous projects in that area including participation in the Cobisa project They always come to the same conclusion which is that the project economics become non workable due power grid constraints and the inability to negotiate a long term wheeling arrangement with PNM He felt like the only reason Cobisa could go forward was due to PNM being the purchaser of power from the project We talked about lower the delivered cost of gas to the facility through a zero return pipeline but in the end what the generation facility would have to compete with is power from and around Palo Verde He is very familiar with the ENA model in fact he could calculate various electric costs immediately just based on some parameters I mentioned to him over the phone In the end he felt like ENA would not want to participate because the risk of having to sell the excess power at a competitive rate was just too great given the cost to get it to a market We will continue to give the Pueblo project a final look by talking to Plains and Four Corners but without the baseload generation the pipeline prospects look pretty dismal ","sent_time":"2000-04-25

fewer large turbines The new pipeline will need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure They have not asked for fuel oil backup I

Team Tino that they pay a 7 06 mo demand charge per KW in addition to the 053 kwh energy charge Tino didn t know whether that was per KW of monthly demand per KW of non coincident peak usage or what The PNM tariff for govt service is priced at 7 16 KW of demand above 10 000kw during peak period peak period is daytime so I assume that is how it is calculated If that is the tariff Schedule 4000B under which DOE really takes service this is interesting because that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate It is also interesting that DOE is paying 053 kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B energy rate is 05072 kwh maybe the difference is surcharges or something Tino s consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an incremental 011 in addition to the 053 kwh energy charge for a total delivered PNM rate to DOE of 064 kwh This is not as good as the 7 cent number Tino threw around earlier in the week but its still not terrible If the bogey is a 10 reduction to the current rate our number to beat is 0576 kwh Tino promised us copies of DOE s actual energy bills to confirm these numbers That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you and I talked about yesterday Kevin Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta s consultant that the Cobisa Belen project is dead Do we know anything about this Interesting I m waiting to hear back

have to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail markets start to open up One more thing to factor in I m expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to talk about Langley s sole source procurement strategy with DOE I hope to get Votaw on the phone with Langley s D C govt contracts lawyers to discuss their theory We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole source strategy is really a high risk approach I m not sure where that would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE into opening the power plant up for bids Langley does not appear interested in trying to win an open bid for the power plant although frankly we would probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning Once we clear up the government contracts issues if ever it seems to me that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions potentially if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland outsourcing strategy and ENA The ENA involvement would be particularly important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the specifications economics that would result I m probably engaging in wishful thinking again but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine heat exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics from the model that James ran If we think this thing is a potentially viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team we need to grab Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA from the bottom up

is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt contracts lawyers at my old firm in DC The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within DOE DOD Bill and Bill does such a meeting sound productive If so should we have outside govt contracts counsel present and if so who do you suggest On a related note Tino explained without me asking or really caring that he was in the middle of a big drafting project revising Dennis joint venture agreement with the Isleta I took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal including structure issues without knowing whether Enron is even on board I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant and that we have not obtained ENA s agreement to commit turbines Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out Enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money turbines etc If Enron does eventually decide to get into this deal the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be revisited Thanks for your patience on this project DF","sent_time":"2000-05-26

EOL I also hope to meet with several of the Commissioners assistants The timing of the meeting is to ensure that we get to them prior to a press release The approach is decidely low key There is a feeling that if we make a big deal of this with FERC then they will ask a lot of questions about why we aren t filing for permission Hopefully if we explain that it doesn t change any of our current practices that its just a new computer tool they will chalk it up as another ecommerce story I hope to talk about the GPG s use of EOL generally and not get deep into the mechanics of the specific TW auction The advantage of me doing the FERC briefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I m not privy to the details of each of the pipelines possible EOL products Attached is a rough outline

a couple of thoughts questions etc that I d like to discuss with you all before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response 1 What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization This deal will not be 100 subscribed for several years optimistically as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing GCNM customers and new power generation load but that part of Tino s story needs more thinking The rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed right We need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years Has GPG ever done deals like that 2 On the GCNM discounting issue it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks a What do GCNM s current discounts look like b How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass i e are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts c Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM tries to undercut the project or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard 3 Assuming we don t have the risk appetite to get in on a project like this how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for Langley s project I assume that if neither TW nor El Paso partner with Langley he ll interconnect with both Do we already have or can we create any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario 4 Is the right of way that Langley has negotiated really all that valuable From Lorraine s memo it seems that the issue of which route is best is half baked at best If that s all Dennis brings to the table not counting his big bag of does a deal with him really make sense I m sure there are a lot of other issues we need to discuss but these are the first that come to mind Please give me a call when you get together to discuss this as I d like to be involved in how we respond to Tino and Dennis Thanks DF Lorraine

Facility Planning identified as being a shorter cheaper route 3 Economic Analysis was run on the three options The attached spreadsheet details project rates and costs 4 Current PNM tariff transmission rates indicate higher rates than potential Albuquerque project rates We know that PNM discounts deeply when necessary to keep a customer from leaving its system but we don t know definitively We continue to research current discounted rates 5 The initial take on the feasibility of this project is good enough to forge ahead Please call me if you have any questions and as to our

contract language etc hopefully within 2 3 weeks of turning Mike loose 2 Regulatory assisted by Maria and me flanges up the FERC abandonment filing and tees it up to file the minute Mike finalizes the deal with Hanover We haven t talked about this for a while but the story we tell FERC has to acknowledge that the monthly O M cost will be higher under our outsourcing deal than it currently is if load factor and other operating assumptions remain constant That may be the key to our story line we argue that outsourcing is necessary to creating flexibility in our cost structure to protect us and our ratepayors from market changes gas flow changes and capacity turnbacks The Compression Services Agreement as it is currently drafted has a two part demand commodity rate Thus if our throuput goes to pot on the segments where these outsourced compressors are or if we have big capacity turnbacks the outsource deal allows us to shed costs quickly Charlie s preliminary cost spreadsheets seem to me to support this strategy I ll talk to Maria and MKM s team about this Also we need to be able to explain to explain that our deal is not all that new or radical It is just a tiny bit different from the many deals FERC has seen where compression or other services are outsourced from the get go with new facilities For example FERC allowed NNG to outsource compressor motor operation and ownership using ECS and by tomorrow hopefully will allow TW to do the same at Gallup Florida has a similar deal as well as intrastates like HPL Maria and I and MKM s folks need to turn over every rock to find examples of similary outsourcing that don t involve Enron We need to let FERC know that the outsourcing train has already left the station and we just want to jump on board 3 We get the abandonment order in the 4th Q and do the deal Will we have the chance to do some more schmoozing and lobbying of FERC folks before we file i e at a prefiling conference See how easy these deals are when you use

of the order If there is anything in it that disadvantages us we should consider rehearing particularly since it is a nearly certain that our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one It might be good for Steve H or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high level courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we ll work with them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah At minimum we ll probably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing I see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on 1 The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days FERC really punted this issue They say that since the expansion capacity is fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly disclose the agreements This is the first time I ve heard of any rule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right to confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info At minimum we could argue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn t even mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of discount reports It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an applicant to file its rate information with the Commission which we did and ignores the regulation Sec 284 7 c 6 that doesn t require a pipeline to publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days after the close of the billing period to which the discount pertained The commercial people need to decide if we care about this issue i e how upset will the customers with the high rates be when they learn about the low rates Also Frank and Steve and Susan since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue do we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing 2 The ECS issue I think we can work around this for the Gallup project by filing a report describing the operational control TW has under the O M agreement I ve talked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will get back to me today My real worry is what the operational control requirement does to our future outsourcing monetization projects I think ECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other deals i e TW compressor monetization in order for both of us to get the accounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams If we agree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal FERC will use it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal Arthur Anderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal which is after all the whole point of doing it if TW retains too much control over the asset I m not sure how to solve this yet but lets all put some thought into it 3 Any others I ll turf to MKM the question of whether we need

the order approving the El Paso ENA transaction For the most part the order is a good one It observes that ENA holds little capacity on TW and that PG E and Socal control a larger portion of capacity on TW With respect to policy matters the order is good in the sense that it reaffirms that a pipeline can withhold capacity to maximize the value of services if shippers are not willing to pay maximum rates My only concern with the order appears in the last paragraph before Section C Here the Commission cautions that its will address on an expedited basis future allegations that TW is not allocating capacity on a non discriminatory basis Certainly the Commission has always had this authority anyway Nonetheless I am a little bit troubled that the Commission is addressing Transwestern at all in an El Paso order TW shouldn t have to read the orders of other pipelines for any directives that apply to it My knee jerk reaction is that we would want clarification that the Commission is just reiterating its general willingness to take up any bona fide complaints and is not imposing any directive on TW But I m guessing you ll probably say we should just let that sentence pass in an otherwise good order that does not involve TW ","sent_time":"2000-01-24

beyond what the tariff and general contract law gave them The subject to agreement by Transwestern language is redundant since the previous clause says by mutual written agreement Additionally its confusing and innacurate because the provided however that clause isn t even binding if we mutually agree to eliminate it I therefore think we ought to take par 4 out or at least remove the provided however clause I don t agree that we can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release We can mutually agree to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap release I suppose we would need to use cap release if the termination or reduction of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another shipper however I would propose one change to Par 3 just to make the discount more clear The par talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary receipts I d add this after the words Appendix A at the end of the current first sentence and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A The discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in Transwestern s East of Thoreau EOT area I m a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both the receipt and delivery end of the deal Susan please work with

Subject Transwestern Contract Approval Request The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures However the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything doesn t give NMNG any rights since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement and it s subject to available capacity Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff I think I would recommend we omit it However NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the deal or at least the conversations of the parties If that s the case I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release Comments ","sent_time":"2000-01-25

allow TW to apply a possible additional future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs through a new surcharge In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as this issue was not a part of the original negotiations However this language as well as the language

indicate that 20 straight line amortization of the total contract payments is the way it 20 should be booked unless there are circumstances to the contrary that would 20 indicate a different allocation over time 20 I don t believe we ll be able to get any good feedback from them on the 20 chokepoint issue It boils down to how blatantly you want to skew the 20 payments and whether they or

pipeline Also I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the market research issue I think Tim could probably identify the specific electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the general tariff rate for large industrial service If we are lucky there might be some info in PNM s last rate case on the discounted electric rates it gives specific large industrials if any Obviously any info on gas or elec loads and rates would be useful Kevin I told Tim you d give him a call to convey further thoughts but this is probably enough to get Tim started I got a call this afternoon from Tino He asked our help on right of way issues with BNSF Could Steve Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we could use Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid tipping PNM that Enron is involved Just in general on the confidentiality issue Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind the current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb 17 We need to be absolutely sure that we don t tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley before then so we don t get them interested in the leglislative fix we are supporting on the Plains Tri State merger Tim believes PNM could spike that leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to That issue is real immediate dollars so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation Tino had a new fact to work into the economics DOE has 6000MMBtu d of pure gas load at Sandia in addition to elec load No number yet on Kirtland gas load Also Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace Montoya at PNM before the end of the year Has anyone else heard that Do we know him I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week just to report in on our analysis At minimum we can probably pass on the name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S D and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway

DF Louis Soldano 02 01 2000 09 40 AM Sent by Jan Cobden To Drew Fossum ET S Enron ENRON Dorothy McCoppin FGT Enron ENRON cc Subject Delineation of Responsibilities Drew and Dot It appears that one of our commercial regulatory lawyers signed off on a right of way agreement that they simply should not have and in my opinion is outside their area of expertise and practice I am going to follow up with the individual on this and it also appears that they were at least in part a victim of a calculated snow job by our brethern over at Enron Northern America as well as a misunderstanding of the marketing affilate rule Along these lines I am concerned that some of our folks in an effort to be responsive to our clients may feel that they have to provide advice in areas where they should be seeking the advice of those who practice in that area on a routine basis I think it would be helpful for the three of us to establish guidelines for our folks on when we would expect them to seek guidance from others who practice in certain primary areas of responsibility For example if an environmental question comes up I would expect any lawyer in our group to talk to Mr Reich or myself If an issue arose with respect to Northern s tariff one would expect that the lawyer would speak to Maria Drew or Dari Let me know what you think and we will go from there Lou ","sent_time":"2000-02-01

cc Stanley Horton Corp Enron Enron Bill Cordes ET S Enron ENRON Rockford Meyer FGT Enron ENRON Subject February 10 Meeting with Dan Larcamp and Team Lorraine Cross has invited me to participate in an outreach meeting with Dan Larcamp and his team on February 10 Also participating in the outreach meeting will be Williams Judy Neason Scott Turkington El Paso Peggy Heeg and Coastal Dan Collins The meeting comes at Larcamp s request and is part of a series of outreach meetings that OMTR is having with other industry groups including producers gas and electric utilities and marketers The purpose of the meeting is not to discuss positions in the current gas NOPR as OMTR is assuming that the Commission will take action on the gas NOPR in February The purpose of the meeting is discuss how markets are changing and talk about upcoming regulatory issues There will be no formal presentations or slides Lorraine will give a 5 minute overview on INGAA s themes on regulatory policy these theme s are per the Board of Directors Task Force on FERC Policy Competition Re contracting challenges Rate discounting Each of the four participating companies will have 5 minutes to relate their pipeline experiences to these themes I would propose to focus my remarks on topic of the continuous contracting state of the pipeline capacity market The point is to tell Larcamp that we are not looking for a regulatory answer to this short term continuous contracting environment What we are seeking is the rate and service flexibility we need to meet these challenges Examples will be the new services flexibility that we continue to seek on TW Enhanced Firm Backhaul Limited Firm And the pricing changes we seek on NNG including seasonal rates Again I don t plan to have any formal slides but here is the outline of the message I would also propose to add some specific examples data on capacity release recent auction experiences and re contracting statistics FYI El Paso plans to talk about the role that negotiated rate transactions will increasingly play in the market place citing their experiences in placing El Paso capacity and their negotiated rate contract extensions on Tenn E Tenn Williams tentatively plans to talk about additional flexibility on offshore pipelines about the need for more self implementing flexibility and the impacts of regulatory delay Please let me know by Monday February 7 is you have any concerns about the general direction of my remarks or about any other issues that you would have me bring up with Larcamp and team ","sent_time":"2000-02-02
