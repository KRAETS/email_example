indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person Ironically when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such If the alumni see that you support our efforts they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work Please provide me any feedback you may have As we talked about today we would like to begin having occasional brown bags in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university I believe that we should have one with Dr Smith to promote the image campaign changes at the university the tier 1 status etc If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well I will send you the date when I have it Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game We will have a tent food refreshments football tickets etc I suspect that it will be from approx 4 00 PM to 10 00 PM Please let me know if your calendar is free I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free we would love to have you Thank you for your time Jeff

Subject Ghana Ken I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana You might remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing from the Ghanaian Ambassador Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate a meeting between you and Chevron We have been working Ghana pretty hard including the West African Gas Pipeline the Effasu Power Project a marketing company and a host of other possibilities We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right now in Nigeria the loss of projects in Cote d Ivoire due to the coup d etat and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana that we are slowing down a bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on additional ones Clearly this is a bit of a cop out I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we are slowing down generally in Africa because I don t want to hurt the barge deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique and there is truth to the Cote d Ivoire and Nigeria issues And of course I don t want to alienate Ghana generally I have a good relationship with the Ambassador from Ghana in fact I just got a postcard from him two days ago and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me I will deliver this message hopefully diverting the call to you If he does get to you first he won t be upset for you to send him on to me I

Mr Nishimuro s Notes What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st century Introduction 1 Awareness of Environmental Issue 1 Environmental issue like Global warming Excessive use of natural resources Recycling Pollution is of major significance The impact on the business is becoming to increase 2 The Kyoto Conference COP3 defined an international framework for dealing with the issue of global warming The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6 for Japan 7 for the U S A 8 for the EU Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism Kyoto Mechanism for International Emissions Trading IET Joint Implement JI and Clean Development Mechanism CDM will be decided on at COP6 which is scheduled for November 2000 GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying 2 GHG Reduction 1 The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change remains uncertain at present and further research is required Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains flexibility 2 Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures economic measures and voluntary measures Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business competition 3 Energy Conservation 1 The U S A is the largest consumer of energy In such a large mobile country much consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector 2 The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy 3 Japan has very limited natural resources and energy conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s As a result Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP Japan s policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental plans and other measures Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at their factories 4 Programme of Industry 1 Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing cost saving in the long run See attached file Einvironmentalissue0118 doc Hitoshi

was a tremendous success and everyone should be congratulated that worked on the planning Now to the final items We are billing everyone for the hotel golf and regatta this week and we have a few questions The hotel and golf are easy However the regatta is a different situation When we started this project the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished We quoted 85 00 per person however the Millennium rate was actually 100 00 per person This would not be such a great problem however we had 33 no shows for the regatta This being said we have two choices We bill those that sailed for an additional 15 00 to make their charge 100 00 which then leaves us with a negative 3500 00 Or we also bill the 33 no shows for 100 00 each which puts us pretty close to break even In the big picture there have been some budget cost that were less than expected and some that were more We will have the final budget complete by the end of next week The most important issue is it acceptable to bill those that sailed 100 00 or do you want us to stay at the original price of 85 00 Then of course what should we do about the no shows Possibly bill them a cancellation fee or the full fee Or forget and forgive this time I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow however my trusted partner Janelle will be here until the 20th of January We would like to get everything finalized before she leaves Give us your thoughts The EX MC Director Sharon
