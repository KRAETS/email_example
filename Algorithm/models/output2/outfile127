wanted to drop you a line to let you know that I am again an employee of UBS As I am sure you are aware we are in process of transition from Enron to UBS I recently filled out all the appropriate

stocks bonds or some other financial product if power ever becomes old hat Furthermore I have will soon receive a signing bonus and a raise so I intend on funding my IRA and my wife s IRA for 2001 and maybe even 2002 If it wouldn t be too much trouble I would like to know what the contribution levels are for 2002 I think I saw something that changed them and the income levels one can have for a Roth As for Molly the advertising business seems to be picking up for 2002 She opened enough new business in the fourth quarter of 2001 to meet her goals and is on her way to making it the first quarter as well I think she is really beginning to understand her business Anyway I currently have lots of time to myself since we are not trading so maybe we can have lunch sometime If that is not possible no big deal I know that you are extremely busy I hope all is well with you and your family Sincerely Bert","sent_time":"2002-01-30
