you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in If you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing that would be helpful With regards to Columbia Business School I applied last year and did not get in due to my GMAT score I decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer which I received an A I am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester I am also retaking the GMAT with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score Last year I was asked back for an interview which I felt was a good sign I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to improve on was my GMAT score Recently I wrote a brief letter to the Dean of Admissions Linda Meehan informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with Columbia I hope that these actions will help me get into Columbia this year My desire to go to Columbia stems from their network location reputation and curriculum Since growing up in Pelham it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while As you can see my desire to go to Columbia is very strong I hope this brief e mail has provided some insight into what I m doing to get into Columbia I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the Woodlands or downtown Again thank you for your interest
