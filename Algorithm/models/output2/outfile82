for the newly competitive market Andersen Consulting in a partnering relationship with the client helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes Using the Poultry Integration Model PIM Andersen helped the chicken use its skills methodologies knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken s people processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital both tacit and explicit and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross median processes The meeting was held in a park like setting enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based industry focused and built upon a consistent clear and unified market message and aligned

Stewart s Tips for Arkansans GENERAL 1 Never take a beer to a job interview 2 Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them 3 It s considered tacky to take a cooler to church 4 If you have to vacuum the bed it is time to change the sheets 5 Even if you re certain that you are included in the will it is still considered rude to drive the U Haul to the funeral home DINING OUT 1 When decanting wine from the box make sure that you tilt the paper cup and pour slowly so as not to bruise the fruit of the vine 2 If drinking directly from the bottle always hold it with your hands ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME 1 A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist 2 Do not allow the dog to eat at the table no matter how good his manners are PERSONAL HYGIENE 1 While ears need to be cleaned regularly this is a job that should done in private using one s OWN truck keys 2 Even if you live alone deodorant is not a waste of good money 3 Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days 4 Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no no as they tend to detract from a woman s jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods DATING Outside the Family 1 Always offer to bait your date s hook especially on the first date 2 Be assertive let her know you re interested I ve been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago 3 Establish with her parents what time she is expected back Some will say 10 00 PM others might say Monday If the latter is the answer it is the man s responsibility to get her to school on time THEATER ETIQUETTE 1 Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended 2 Refrain from talking to characters on the screen Tests have proven they can t hear you WEDDINGS 1 Livestock usually is a poor choice for a wedding gift 2 Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot 3 For the groom at least rent a tux A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance 4 Though uncomfortable say yes to socks and shoes for that special occasion DRIVING ETIQUETTE 1 Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight 2 When approaching a four way stop the vehicle with the largest tires does not always have the right of way 3 Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape 4 When sending your wife down the road with a gas can it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer too

a Hawgdriver s dream no more of this sending GPS guided bombs from the ionosphere I want to camp out on the enemy s border I want to yell across the border in the immortal words of Wyatt Earp as portrayed by Kurt Russell You tell em I m coming AND HELL S COMING WITH ME I wanna punch Bin Laden in the face and say You gonna do something Or just stand there and bleed And then I wanna laugh maniacally as my 30mm shells decimate his camps I ain t talking about the Armor Piercing shells this time although the thought of poisoning their lungs if in the unlikely event they survived my attack with the dirty dust of spent uranium is quite refreshing that would make the cloud over New York seem like pure Oxygen I want High Explosive Incendiary HEI rounds 1150 of them fired 2 or 3 hundred at a time like 3 hundred grenades exploding all at once and that s just my jet the three coming with me brings that total to 16 cans of CBU 87 that s 3 232 individual submunitions for them that s what I want I want 4 Maverick missiles per jet that s 16 of those things and if we run outta trucks and other small things to hit with those missiles I wanna find out what a maverick will do when it locks onto a terrorist and hits him at just over 1000 feet per second there might not be enough deceleration to detonate the thing but at that speed I don t think it would be necessary And I want 2 pods of rockets hanging from my wings Seven white phosphorous and seven HEI I want the Willie Petes to put a cloud of smoke to climb into the sky to let everyone following know that s where the gettin is good And the HEI well I just want FRAG in the air tearing apart their greasy scumbag bodies the same way they tore into our nation and then we ll start cleaning up with the almighty General Electric GAU 8

what else I want I want John Madden Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long to take over CNN NBC ABC and every other news network to provide coverage of this war I want Madden with his electronic chalkboard out there describing what s going on You see here across the top of the screen that ridge line is exactly where the attack is gonna come from you ll see the Warthawgs come popping over them and unleash a fury that we haven t seen since Lawrence Taylor was on the prowl Speaking of that here they come and BAM These guys are great they remind me of linemen they don t get much press coverage but when they hit you man do you know it I want Hank Williams Jr and Lee Greenwood belting out I M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN as the intro to Monday Night Air Strikes Fight night would have a whole new meaning now I want to see Sports Center air the HIT OF THE DAY Today s strike comes from a flight of two A 10 Warthogs You ll see here that some terrorist got the wild idea that he could shoot at these guys you can see the missile come up and totally miss the two jets and here you see as they roll in and unleash that awesome gun on the point of origin nothing left there now And that s our PLAY OF THE DAY I want Mills Lane in the field giving play by play descriptions I want Flight of the Valkaries playing at full bore from every mountainside as we run in at 100 feet I want WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE playing after the first bomb hits and when I m WINCHESTER ammunition I wanna land on Bin Laden s personal airstrip grab him by his twisted dead neck and poke him in the eyes and say YOU JUST GOT KNOCKED OUT I want the NFL cheerleaders to send us off to war and the XFL cheerleaders to welcome us home And while we re at it I don t just want to beat the crap outta these scumbags I want to humiliate them too I want to see Schwartzkopf come outta retirement to start kicking some butt I want a cure for Alzheimer s right now to get Reagan back in working order and like Dennis Leary says I want a cure for cancer to

A Women s Primer on Men Don t know if you ve seen this or not TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO S HAD ENOUGH You really want to figure us out Here s a start 1 Learn to work the toilet seat If it s up put it down We need it up you need it down You don t hear us gripping about you leaving it down do you No of course not That would be stupid and there are far more important things to be worried about You don t try to sit in the driver s seat without opening the dammed car door do you 2 If you won t dress like the Victoria s Secret girls don t expect us to act like soap opera guys 3 If you think you re fat you probably are Don t ask us Its a stupid question and we refuse to answer 4 Don t cut your hair Ever Long hair is always more attractive than short hair Period One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair and by then you re stuck with her 5 Birthdays Valentines and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again 6 Here s a real easy one If you ask a question you don t want an answer to expect an answer you don t want to hear 7 Asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to and then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite direction is a really stupid thing to do 8 Sometimes we re not thinking about you Live with it 9 Don t ask us what we re thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint the shotgun formation or monster trucks 10 Sunday Sports It s like the full moon or the changing of the tides Let it be 11 Shopping is not a sport and no we re never going to think of it that way 12 When we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine Really 13 You have enough clothes 14 You have too many shoes 15 Crying is blackmail and you know it Knock it off 16 Let s be clear on this one Ask for what you want I repeat ask for what you want Subtle hints don t work Strong hints don t work Really obvious hints don t work Just say it No your having to ask for something does NOT automatically make it not worth getting If it did you might as well give back the car the house and that last raise you got And NO trying to punish us by acting like you don t want the thing 30 seconds after you were compelled to ask for it will not teach us a lesson or jumpstart the ESP gland within our underdeveloped craniums Here s the math write it down somewhere ASK GET NO ASK NO GET 17 No we don t know what day it is We never will Mark anniversaries on the calendar 18 Peeing standing up is more difficult We re bound to miss sometimes 19 Most guys own three pairs of shoes What makes you think we d be any good at choosing which pair out of thirty would look good with your dress 20 Whether or not you believe it yes and no are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question 21 Come to us with a problem if you want help solving it That s what we do Occasionally we can go out on a limb and attempt to empathize However be warned that approaching us with a problem without clearly indicating which you want solutions or empathy will likely result in you getting neither Tricky system but that s just the way it works 22 Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for 23 A headache that lasts for 17 months is a medical problem See a doctor 24 Foreign films are best left to foreigners Unless it s Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan where it doesn t really matter what they re saying 25 Check your oil 26 If we tell you that you look beautiful at 5 30 in the morning or any other time when you are dirty mussed up or otherwise not perfectly coiffed we really do mean it Telling us that we don t really pisses us off and further decreases the likelihood of your hearing anything of the sort when you are fishing for compliments 27 It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together 28 No it doesn t matter which quiz 29 Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument 30 All comments become null and void after 7 days 31 If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry we meant the other one 32 Let us ogle stare We re going to look anyway it s genetic and we know you do it too 33 You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something but not both 34 Whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during commercials 35 If it itches it will be scratched 36 If we ask what s wrong and you say nothing we will act like nothing s wrong If we ask and you say that something is wrong we would greatly appreciate your helping us out by actually telling us what it is before our aforementioned inability to read minds once again quickly takes the place of the actual issue at hand 37 When we are with the guys or watching sports or both we are bound to look say do or act stupid It doesn t bother us It shouldn t bother you Thank you for reading this Yes I know I have to sleep on the couch tonight We really don t mind that though it s kind of like camping and we get the remote all to ourselves Sincerely The Men "},{"message_mailbox":"hyatt-k","recipient_count":"1","message_subject":"RE: TW project
