smaller bid ask spread and a network externality locks in the inferior currency Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network externality How do our bid ask spreads compare to the alternatives available to our competitors Do we stand willing to

myself Paul and I were hoping to have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to describe in person what we re all about And to be clear we re not looking for Enron money we are raising money from private individuals We ve already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the Enron Genesis business relationship I also wanted to get your views on Enron s approach to oil trading and whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity Frankly I think Vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they ve enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult They have an unbelievable franchise but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which could be exploited to Enron s benefit I m shooting in the dark here but hopefully it s worth some discussion If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet it would be greatly appreciated Paul and I could come to your office or possibly you could come to our offices over on

We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone attend the Associate and or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a representative on the Committees Unfortunately it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the existing PRC Reps Additionally as you are aware the PRC meetings are next week December 12th 13th and there is not enough time to gather information We will however be reducing the number of Associates and Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional Reps If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names to Terry Bosien The parameters that were used for the initial appointments were as follows The person must be a well respected individual who is nominated approved by the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents The Analyst PRC Reps are directors sr directors The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for several reasons First Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond their business unit boundaries Additionally it potentially places the PRC Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if they are required to disagree with a more senior individual We have also received request from individuals wanting to observe the meeting As in the MD VP process individuals are not allowed to just observe if they are not a part of the Committee We attempted to have the major units represented however it is not possible to have every division represented Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining why the individuals selected as PRC Reps rather than the Associates Analysts managers should be the ones to represent the Associates Analysts in the PRC He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps responsibilities which was to 1 meet with the Associates and Analysts managers 2 gather as much information as possible and 3 advocate objectively for the individual Also if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or impossible to come to a consensus which has been the case in the past I hope this is helpful If business units find this is not acceptable they should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling Thanks for your understanding cooperation and support

the National MS Society s 2000 Man of the Year and will be honored at a dinner on September 30 He has been a big supporter of the MS Society primarily through his riding the MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997 This year s ride is April 15 16 and he has been busy collecting pledges 20 000 so far which will be matched by the Enron dollar for dollar Enron Corp has the largest MS150 team in the nation in terms of dollars raised and this year our goal is 350 000 It appears that our 378 person team has already blown through that goal and is well on its way to raising 400 000 As MS has touched my family I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so actively support research to find a cure I m sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends

took a trip to Rockford Illinois to visit Phil Morrow who has been struggling with MS for the past 12 years The pictures tell the rest of the story I would say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter sweet Bottom line count your blessings we never know what life has in store for us I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk Party in May I have done this for the last 10 years I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as I thought I had MS Fortunately my Neurologist thinks that I had a small stroke back in 91 never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD news Now I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a cure to help him As always I collect donations from anyone and everyone who is interested and or able If you would like to send in a donation simply write out a check for whatever amount to NMSS National Multiple Sclerosis Society and send it to Chuck Paul 6193 Forest Hills Dr Norcross Ga 30092 4513 My email address is listed below

decided to resign from Enron For some time now I have wanted to take some time off and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid unvested sabbatical Primarily for reasons of precedence he was unwilling to pursue this option which while it is disappointing to me I accept The purpose of this note is twofold First I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly Second I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non compete provisions with regard to future payouts I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor At present I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying and travelling with my family I have nothing planned professionally as of yet but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively I hope that s not too presumptuous Please let me know your thoughts on this non compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward Again Jeff thanks for many great
