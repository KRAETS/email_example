have relating to PCA PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998 At the time of PCA s bankruptcy PCA owed a 5 3 million receivable to EPMI On EPMI s books this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out of the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted contract provided for one way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default and some funds from credit After netting all these amounts there is still a 600 000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors and the legal effect of the one way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable Accordingly unless I hear otherwise from you I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the 600 000 PCA receivable now and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors we would then give such amounts received from

Babak Pooya SouthernEnergy Com cc Edmonds Sonnet sonnet edmonds SouthernEnergy Com Subject RE Oct 13 Meeting Follow Up Andy I could provide language by the end of next week if needed by then Separately I understand that we intend to emphasize marketing efforts towards all potential EEI users but utilities in particular due to that group s lower acceptance rate to date Another group to which I believe that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading platforms Three types of online trading platforms presently exist 1 proprietary exchanges EnronOnline Dynegydirect 2 consortium platforms ICEX and 3 independent third party platform Altra these platforms are similar to 2 but differ in that the shareholders backers have not committed liquidity The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are significant and growing According to MegawattDaily Ameren Energy conducts about 40 of next day deals and 30 of forwards on various electronic platforms There are presently close to 25 platforms of course with so many competitors as usually happens there will probably be a weeding out and or consolidations mergers the Jurassic period notwithstanding as blame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or possibly the taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs according to Larsen all apologies for the joke As each platform system has different definitions products and contracts and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard contracts I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive standard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a default agreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading partners lack executed Masters with the counterparty In fact according to published sources Houston Street RedMeteor and others have been working with others for several months on developing industry standards Just

your email 1 I would agree that OPG is mistaken After the meeting Chris and I and others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied a contract administrator why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w a product definition that works with the physical master I know Chris is already working on this From what it sounds like the Ontario pool is not that different from NEPOOL In UI Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master 2 I also agree that in pools a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made not a single MW flowing This is what we did in UI This is what we do in the California pool This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries but agree that the language could be more direct With the California product CAISO energy we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future In general fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated Fm is only possible if the pool fails Just FYI the god awful Into product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non pool market we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points and not be allowed to call a fm within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable

more transactions that are settled against a floating published index price Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed Under ISDA for financial trading this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event MDE Under ENA s standard contract for financial trading there is included as a MDE the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price you would be required under ISDA to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE If you treat the imposition of a cap say in CA of prices to 500 or in NEPOOL to 1 000 as a MDE then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me Alternatively if caps are not deemed a MDE then you would always settle against the published prices even if they are artificially determined after the trade was entered into While caps are not appealing I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this So depending upon what you both think we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue Thanks for

claim is in its preliminary stages I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking As you will remember we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over 5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount Bill In connection with this matter it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information 1 Date and amount of last payment made by PCA splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from EPMI I would assume that payment for April deliveries was made accordingly I would assume that the last payment we received from PCA would have been around May 20th 2 Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for 3 The details of how you calculated the net MTM

transmission and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission Attendees from Dynegy will include Griff Jones Dynegy s head of trading Matt whose last name I didn t get and their lawyer Harlan Murphy If you think somebody else should attend or if you want them to come over here let me know and I can talk to Harlan Assuming the meeting stays scheduled I will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet with Dynegy As you are aware in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define what an Into Product is Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined Dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that EEI s Into product was flawed Their position while not completely expressed hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are making deliveries on firm transmission then the Seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason in general this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to Buyer s use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to Buyer s attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area Dynegy s approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical At the time we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product Dynegy s concept was rejected at the EEI meetings I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals 1 Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition We trade Into extensively with them but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading Critical to clear up this ambiguity 2 Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI Because Dynegy was so vocal against EEI s Into definition if they now started using EEI it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice against the Into definition 3 Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes Because the Into product is such an important part of East trading today it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate Additionally it is critical that we start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in transmission such as the advent of RTOs with long term Into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an RTO Call me with any questions thoughts Thanks Elizabeth 36349","recipient_address":"kevin.presto@enron.com, rogers.herndon@enron.com,

revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on 20 Wednesday My comments primarily involve the following 1 As you and I discussed last week I thought it made sense to specify a 20 reasonable date by which Enron and PG E shall have reached closure on a 20 settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims I 20 proposed a one month period to do that If the parties can 01 t come to an 20 agreement in that time period then the 01 mechanics 018 in the MPA for re solving 20 a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be 20 01 reactivated 018 Obviously if we are making progress the parties can always 20 extend the date I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to 20 make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution 20 Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon the conditions of the 20 extension of the 01 stay 018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement itself 20 as opposed to this letter 2 Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t he 20 parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached and 20 that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter Thus the 20 revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the 01 Initial Extensi on 20 Period 018 i e to May 25 2001 Your draft had provided that Enron wou ld be 20 required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b e 20 reached My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the 20 Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto if agreed 20 to by Enron should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t he 20 parties rather than as part of this letter Also we note that as a 20 contractual matter the MPA does not require the non defaulting party to ke ep 20 in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when as a result of a 20 termination the non defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part y 20 See Sec 5 5 3 Your draft of the letter provided that Enron 01 agrees 018 to enter in to new 20 master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on 01 commercially 20 reasonable terms 018 The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to 20 negotiate with PG E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations 20 towards a settlement agreement but any commitment on Enron 01 s part to ef fect 20 a contract or transaction with PG E will only arise as a result of the 20 parties 01 execution of the definitive transaction documents as opposed t o 20 this letter the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac h 20 of the parties Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin g 20 or on the revised letter Thanks in advance for your help in moving this 20 forward Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 09 Witalis Lawrence Law LCW4 pge com 0904 25 2001 07 23 PM 09 09 20 09 09 To

discussed during the last conference call attached is a revised Article 8 Credit Provisions to the EEI Contract along with a revised section for the Cover Page The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed to during the conference call I tried blacklining but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes Maybe you will have better success I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group The only changes that were not discussed on the call other than those resulting from the global restructuring that I made are as follows 1 Changed the Section entitled Performance Assurance to Collateral Threshold Use of PA seemed misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral 2 Added the words acceptable to Party in new Section 8 1 d and 8 2 d in order to clarify as we did in Sections 8 1 a and 8 2 a that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party 3 Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are Applicable or Not Applicable As always thanks for your help

and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing I like the proposal to merge the discussions but You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn t consider merging the discussions contracting groups After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer Shari s name came up a lot he said he did not think it would ever work I m all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members drafting committee and all would relish it as well What do you think is the next best step ps the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK Lets talk about this also Hoping not to stay the course again Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager 713
