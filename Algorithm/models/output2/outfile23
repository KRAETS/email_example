all Appalachian Pool Operators Received 3 29 00 2 00 pm Reclassification Notice Posted 3 29 00 2 00 pm On February 10 1999 the FERC approved Docket No CP97 549 granting CNG Transmission s CNGT s request for reclassification of various transmission lines to gathering lines As part of that Docket several transmission lines were denied to gathering On March 12 1999 CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification On March 21 2000 the FERC approved Docket No CP97 549 001 granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines The newly reclassified gathering lines include D 2149 H 19921 LN 943 H 124 and H 21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station On March 22 2000 CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1 2000 Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of 0 198 Dt and a fuel retention of 2 28 for all gas moved on the lines listed above If you have questions regarding this notice please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 304 623 8698 or Celesta Miracle at 304 623 8262 April 3 2000 Received 4 3 00 11 10 am Posted 4 3 00 11 10 am Dear Pool Operator CNG Transmission Corporation CNGT plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant H E P out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12 01 a m on Tuesday September 12 2000 This requires that the wet gas system behind the H E P in West Virginia be shut in The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty one 21 days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday October 3 2000 All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT s local operations supervisor in the production area Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT all wet gas production must be shut in by 5 00 p m on Monday September 11 2000 This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time lines on our schedule As per CNGT s tariff failure to shut in by 5 00 p m will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine and in an effort to minimize confusion producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT s local operations supervisor We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in CNGT will not notify producers individually We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year The next regularly scheduled shut down will not be until 2002 If you have any questions about this letter please feel free to contact me at 304 623 8698 Sincerely Nancy M Aucremanne Manager

Sullivan s interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I haven t heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buy sells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buy sell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enron s then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work

the citygate and hook it up as a buy sell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now he s priorities are just a bit different I guess why I m a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA s Wade Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal If

toilet water and have both lids lifted 3 Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom 4 In one smooth movement put the cat in the toilet and close both lids you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape CAUTION Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find 5 The cat will self agitate and make ample suds Never mind the noises that come from your toilet the cat is actually enjoying this 6 Flush the toilet three or four times This provides a power wash and rinse which I have found to be quite effective 7 Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door 8 Stand behind the toilet as far as you can and quickly lift both lids The now clean cat will rocket out of the toilet and run outside where he will dry himself Sincerely The Dog ","message_folder":"sent"},{"sent_time":"2000-03-09

Received 2 29 00 11 30 am Posted 2 29 00 11 30 am Dear Producers and Shippers In January you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29 2000 We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until 1 it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or 2 CNG develops a compression pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you If you have any questions regarding this notice please contact Joe Thompson at 304 623

because it is vague Enron needs this agreement signed so we can nominate the gas under Enron s accounts on TCO We need CES s help in getting this matter resolved ASAP Thanks

love someone and not be loved in return but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to begrateful for that gift Love is when you take away the feeling the passion and the romance in a relationship and find out you still care for that person A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ve ever had It s true the we don t know what we ve got until we lose it but it s also true that we don t know what we ve been missing until it arrives Giving someone all your love is never assurance that they ll love you back Don t expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn t be content it grew in yours There are things you d love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you would like to hear them from but don t be so deaf as not to hear it from the one who says it from his heart Never say good bye if you still want to try never give up if you still feel you can go on never say you don t love a person anymore if you can t let go Love comes to those who still hope although they ve been disappointed There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real Hope you dream of that special someone Dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do Always put yourself in others shoes If you feel that it hurts you it probably hurts the person too A careless word may kindle strife a cruel word may wreck a life a timely word may level stress a loving word may heal and bless The happiest of people don t necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way Happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives Love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can t go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches When you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling Live your life so that when you die you re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying

Dear West Virginia Producer Over the last several years Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers For this second offering the process we will use is as follows For a period of 30 days beginning 12 00 Noon on May 24 2000 the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station The Dominion bubbles affected are 4404 4405 Dominion recognizes that although limited there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering Production Office The application must indicate the amount of incremental gas for the specific compression agreement Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement Your name company name and address state of incorporation phone and fax number as well as an e mail address if available should be included please print or type Forward this information to Joseph A Thompson Manager Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering

and the capacity requests You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved Please realize that this is a window and the opportunity

This goes on for about forty minutes She s yelling Ohhh God He s hanging on to her hips for dear life This is the most athletic sex imaginable Finally they both collapse panting on the ground The guy watching is amazed He thinks he has learned something about life that he didn t know After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on The guy still watching thinks That is amazing he was going like a train I ve got to ask him what his secret is As the couple pass the guy says to them That was something else you must have been shagging for about forty minutes How do you manage it Is there some sort of secret No there s no secret the old man says except fifty years ago that fucking fence wasn t electric

memo is on the EBB several times FYI May 9 2000 9 40 a m Dear West Virginia Producer Over the last several years Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers For this second offering the process we will use is as follows For a period of 30 days beginning 12 00 Noon on May 10 2000 the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations The Dominion bubbles affected are 3219 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214 3215 3216 3217 3218 3220 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208 3209 3210 3211 3212 and 3213 for Yellow Creek station Dominion recognizes that although limited there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering Production Office The application must indicate the amount of incremental gas for the specific compression agreement Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement Your name company name and address state of incorporation phone and fax number as well as an e mail address if available should be included please print or type Forward this information to Joseph A Thompson Manager Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg WV 26301 After all requests are received we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved Please realize that this is a window and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12 2000 I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression You can contact Joe Thompson at 304 623 8709 or Dan Stuart at 304 623 8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression

I ll let Kevin answer this one ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes 2 I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1 If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001 However I don t remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day we are buying back gas at GD 01 3 Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price Does Duke bill CES directly for this 4 See attached worksheets 5 I don t know all the information on the local production yet The pricing I m currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing pricing using ENA transport The attached April file has a Local Production tab Molly Johnson is updating this information After she completes April she will recreate Jan Mar 6 Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same I m not concerned about the individual citygate volumes For pricing purposes I only care about total daily deliveries It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don t have enough capacity This holds true for most other pipelines as well Tenn Z6 CNG North Citygate CNG South Citygate This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa dkinney columbiaenergygroup com on 04 18 2000 09 40 36 AM To Chris Germany enron com

Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly Please look it over and let s talk The items are not prioritized in any way 1 Enron s invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie Indiana Gas off ANR the price index used is Michcon citygate GD M I The same is true for delivery points into Michcon Is this correct or are you actually using ANR ML 7 plus the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML 7 as the price index for Michcon 2 CES has completely exited the following market areas zones as of April 1 TCO 6 11 TCO 6 12 However because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes for these two market areas in April 00 CES had to purchase from and resell to Enron 90 of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1 Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000 Are we required to do a purchase sell back in each of these future months or can we dispense with this I refer you to Section 3 6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency Agreement p 11 12 as having some bearing on this issue 3 The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are incorrect The 4 200 Dth is a monthly volume not a Dth day volume Since the supply for this point is already arranged as a back to back with Duke Energy and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas I do not intend to do a simultaneous buy sell with Enron of the volumes in excess of the erroneous Exhibit 1 volume If you disagree let s discuss 4 According to Exhibit 1 CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4 21 O R TCO 7 3 West Ohio TGP Zone 6 Boston Gas would you please provide me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES s agent on a monthly basis for April at each of these points I also need these numbers for January February and March 5 How is the local production behind NYSEG NFGD PA and CPA priced 6 How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas was merely being re directed from one delivery point where we were long for that day to another delivery point where we were short There will undoubtedly be other questions I will direct them to you as they arise Thanks Doug Kinney Ph 703 561 6339

April 00 Requirements for 4 10 00 and after The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for and the following day s as listed There are three worksheets labelled as follows Total Reqs Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled NOM The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice CES schedulers note the attached file is archived on P Energy Ops Enron April 00 Daily xls so you don t have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network Daily Change shows the change increase decrease in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date For the current gas day the change is an intra day change and is calculated using the previous day s volume request for the current day e g If the current gas day is 3 28 then the change is computed with respect to the 3 27 request for 3 28 Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated For tomorrow s gas day and any subsequent ones shown the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First of the month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first of the month to the FOM supply for the future days shown e g If today is 3 28 then the change for 3 29 3 30 etc is computed with respect to the first of the month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell backs since the first of the month thru 3 27 This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back The column labelled ENA Daily Swing vs FOM volume shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre specified prices Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre specified pricing must be negotiated TCO Storage Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its paper storage injection for the month Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the Daily Change worksheet Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues Doug Kinney
