themselves into trouble again AP A Texas A M University student who claimed he had been raped by a dog was yesterday jailed for 12 months Martin Hoyle 20 was arrested by police after the passengers of a passing car witnessed a Bull Terrier called Badger having sex with Hoyle on the side of Highway 290 just north of Hempstead Assistent District attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers of the car an unidentified couple from Houston had stopped to help because they thought Hoyle was being attacked by the animal But when they got closer they saw that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles was down on all fours and the dog was straddling him from behind The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken a liking to him said Mr Crossland The couple were extremely offended and sickened by what they saw Another individual in a passing car contacted police on a cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog on the feeder road Hoyle of College Station told police I can t help it if the dog took a liking to me He tried to rape me He repeated the rape allegation at the police station and added The dog pulled my jeans down Hoyle who has been arrested several times on alcohol related charges was jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act that outraged public decency His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incident because of his intoxicated state but was now very remorseful and incredibly embarrassed Jailing him Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle Never before in my time at the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with

night but I needed to leave abruptly or I felt I would have lost it even more You are right This is a very difficult time in my life However I want you to know that you are a very special person to me The more I get to know you the more I realize that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it off so well so very quickly I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you but right now there is just too much anger mistrust and hurt in my emotions to allow that All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have imagined These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you likely don t understand it all fully I am not sure I understand it fully I fear I am making a big mistake because I know you won t be available long You have so much to offer beautiful intelligent funny and someone who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship All of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we orginally met When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions I freaked out because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to realize that I would hurt you So I completely pulled back thinking I should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future Believe me it is not easy to stay away from you because even though we have only known each other a short time I miss you and think about you a lot It would be hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night My kidding you about Lee I will have to admit also shows my insecurity about that Mexico was so wonderful because except for that one night I was able to put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you I think that is why we had such a great time Cynthia when we were together on that trip I felt a lightness that I haven t felt in a long time You looked so beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar and it was all about us and nothing else I have been through it enough to know that reality of my situation creeps back eventually Cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note I feel like crying Sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like a cruel joke I think the timing of our meeting was ill fated I know we will talk to and see each other again but I know it will be different now As much as I want to hold on to you I know its stupid to attempt to keep you close and yet at some distance You have are too smart and have too much to offer to put up with that Please know that I do have genuine feelings for you and I miss you Gerald

official release date Eric Gillaspie 05 15 2000 01 40 PM To Gerald Nemec HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Coen Bros Coens hit most notes in Brother O Brother Where Art Thou Southern comedy drama color PG 13 1 46 By Todd McCarthy Daily Variety Chief Film Critic CANNES Variety A musically tinged riff on The Odyssey set in the Depression era Deep South O Brother Where Art Thou is a charming if lightweight Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial cumulative impact which will likely translate into just OK box office results come domestic release in the fall While the film s epigraph and inspiration come from Homer its title derives from Preston Sturges film biz classic Sullivan s Travels in which the successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called O Brother Where Art Thou Despite appropriating the handle the Coens aren t about to fall into the trap of pretentiousness themselves crafting instead a seriocomedy that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals with the leader Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney telling his cronies Pete John Turturro and Delmar Tim Blake Nelson that he knows where 1 2 million is buried The first person they encounter however a blind black man driving a railway handcar warns them that they will find treasure out there but not the treasure they re seeking A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology It s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart he advises Everett stands by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism Picking up a young black musician Tommy Johnson Chris Thomas King on the road the fellows wander into an isolated radio station recording studio and posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys cut a lively tune and are paid a few bills for their efforts They then take off again and remain oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the lushly verdant landscapes which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in slightly washed out and burnished hues that are a constant delight They hook up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson a wonderfully live wired Michael Badalucco who hates his nickname Babyface and goes into a huge post crime funk In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of visuals performance and music the boys come upon three sirens who seduce them in a watery glade when Pete disappears thereafter the dense Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad which he proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory one eyed salesman for the word of God a Cyclops like John Goodman squeezes the critter to death while beating the other two silly Pete eventually turns up again only to become perturbed when Everett reveals that his real goal rather than the nonexistent treasure is to reunite with the mother of his seven daughters Penny Holly Hunter who is about to marry another fellow In the course of things the errant adventurers brush up against local politics a governor s race that pits old incumbent Pappy O Daniel Charles Durning against a reform candidate whose motto Friend of the Little Man is literally represented by a broom toting dwarf who accompanies him at every campaign stop After slipping in a quiet homage to Sullivan s Travels in which members of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a picture show the Coens deliver one of their major set pieces a stupendously choreographed Ku Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes the invasion of the Wicked Witch s castle by Dorothy s friends in The Wizard of Oz Raucous the devil gets his due musical climax is fun and given a big charge by Durning in a splendid performance capping turn but is also rather too fairy tale ish and too good to be true to truly satisfy leaving this an Odyssey without full closure Lack of irony and complexity in the wrap up may be a shortcoming but it also points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the film s portrait of dimwits con men rednecks and country folk Most of the characters including the three leads may be dumb misguided and delusional but they are also engaging and straightforward to be enjoyed for the colorful oddballs that they are Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everett s vanity and in delivering the Coens carefully calibrated high toned dialogue Turturro and Nelson a character actor who directed the 1997 indie Eye of God and the upcoming Othello update O are a real dumb and dumber combo without veering into slapstick while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness from Durning and well known regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root as the blind recording entrepreneur musician King as the boys sometime collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the escapees to the bitter end Not as elaborate as The Hudsucker Proxy or The Big Lebowski pic is nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins splendid camerawork blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassner s evocative production design Mary Zophres imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are all but imperceptible as such watch for that cow Delta blues music a combo of T Bone Burnett and pre existing tunes is another major plus Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney Pete John Turturro Delmar Tim Blake Nelson Pappy O Daniel Charles Durning Big Dan Teague John Goodman George Nelson Michael

Marathon as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform as such risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner Mariner s transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons For these reasons I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such a transfer to MEGS Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the Production Handling Agreement Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement and becoming jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not
