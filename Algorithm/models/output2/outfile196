COINCIDENCE PROBABLY BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN T BE IGNORED THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH THIS WEEK S WINDFALL PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS GOV GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN CONT MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT AND THE GENERATORS WEREN T IMPRESSED AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS RELIANT ENERGY S REI JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE THE STATE S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES WMB FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT IT S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME THEN AFTER YOU BEAT THEM THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE THE UTILITIES THE ISO AND NOW THE CONT STATE TREASURY TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH THE WINDFALL PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO OBVIOUSLY PRICE CAPS HAVEN T WORKED JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME IN FACT PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE AT BEST PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES CALIFORNIA S PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES IT CAN T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN T EXACTLY IBM S BIG BLUE VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES HUMAN TRADERS COULD CONT HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM FOR EXAMPLE IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY IT S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST MARY S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE AND 10 YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO

WALL STREET ANALYSTS ON FEB 28 THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA FROM THE GOVERNOR S OFFICE TO DATE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE THEN NOTHING THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS SPECIAL SAID STANFORD ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10 000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD HAVE REAL TIME METERS EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES SAID WOLAK CONT ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE SELLERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND THE TIME OF DAY WOLAK SAYS AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME BUT MAKING 25 OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE MARKET ACCORDING TO WOLAK BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT PRICE CAPS A WINDFALL PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS
