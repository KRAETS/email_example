regarding the complaint against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts to Amoco and Burlington of 3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs of 15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased Accordingly producers are seeking a minimum of 17 million in compensation in some form or another The biggest concern is that a total of 1 2 bcf day is being nominated at the Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu day Socal Gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled referred to as Gatekeeper The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could be implemented as early as October 1 2001 When the Gatekeeper is implemented only 540000 mmbtu day will be accepted at the Socal Topock border and must match up with the intra state transport SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1 2 bcf day of nominations at the Topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity 400 to Mohave 540 to Socal Topock and 180 to PGE Topock They also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but needed a minimum of 300 to meet core needs However they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced They also agreed to live with the status quo until the Gatekeeper was implemented This would result in firm rights being established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment After much discussion El Paso came back with the following counter proposal Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented Does not relate to receipt point rights 1 Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock 198000 2 Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock 614000 3 Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000 d which can go to Topock or Ehrenberg It is recommended that they give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional 70000 mmbtu day from Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx 115000 being shifted to Ehrenberg 4 Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows Socal Topock PGE Mohave Topock Texaco 40 135 Burlington 26 74 Aero 5 15 Borax 7 12 LADWP 0 36 SWGas 0 20 5 Socal Topock would now be divided as follows Expansion Shippers 78000 Socal Gas 425000 BLK 3 348000 25 Amoco 20 Oneok 99 Williams 189 El Paso Merchant 15 Wlliams Total 851000 540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3 Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El Paso s counter proposal Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent thruput increased Will accept CD reduction rate design change or other forms of compensation For the recommended volumes moved to Mohave Pge Topock they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate In other words if the producers used the delivery point they would pay max rate If they did not they would not pay anything Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor maybe 70 percent For volumes shifted to non Socal Points they also want a 100 percent volumetric rate Bottom line is how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this case Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will study its entirety No follow up meeting was scheduled Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived gaming on the system by the full requirements customers ie nominating more gas than they need in anticipation of cuts It is thought that if this could be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows El Paso recommended the following Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan based on previous day s total nom from all basins No limits on Cycle 2 4 This caused some concerns because of week end load swings andfluctuatingpower plant loads However eoc s were willing to establish a technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets resolved Regarding pooling El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the bondad This process is in its early stages of conflict Most people Duke Southern Williams Coral are not on board with this I will keep you advised of development Please advise if you have any questions ","message_folder":"sent","sent_time":"2000-07-14
