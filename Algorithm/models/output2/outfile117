about cars for Mom and Dad My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me I only considered CR Recomended cars There are a few options in the 20 000 to 25 000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria Mecury Grand Marquis but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to The only car in the 30 000 to 35 000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I m not sure they want to spend this kind of money Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the 40 000 to 45 000 range Dad said he spent 23 000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue
