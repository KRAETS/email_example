issues you both are dealing with but we need to start thinking about the PRC process Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are With the exception of VP s and above do we want to isolate EGM employees and review them only within EGM regardless of location Or do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA ex Europe Singapore Sydney etc employees review with EEL North American based employees review with ENA We ll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging markets rather than with mature and high revenue generating markets like North

Jeffrey A Shankman HOU ECT ECT cc Subject discussion jeff when I came to Houston in late December there were if you recall a number of issues that I had hoped to discuss with you We only really scratched the surface with the reorganisation announced today I would prioritise them as follows 1 recruiting training and keeping talent there is a lack of depth in the organisation to make matters worse most of the recruiting was done by greg whalley and now all of those traders are on expiring or expired contracts the fact that all of them on the international side received bonuses less than last year doesn t help also the industry is expansion mode so it is harder to recruit and keep talent we are running the risk of getting left with the unhireable and losing the best 2 vision having worked for enron for three years i realise that the company seeks self starters one of the frustrations that I have in Europe and is a problem with the group overall is that too many of the employees are on their heels waiting for direction from above that is one of the things I was hoping we might address in a reorganisation that shrunk the business units smaller teams would be more focused on opportunities to grow the business communicate better and energise the environment still we need as senior management to discuss in a more specific sense where we need to improve the most you have identified customer business eol and research as the three key areas I would like to discuss with you the priority of being able to sell physical fuels the easiest thing to do is get long expensive oil and the hardest thing to do is develop a system this group has made almost no progress in developing a physical system that is what I will be working on in the heating diesel and jet fuel markets I would have thought the greatest and first opportunity that we need to be exploiting is fuel supply to utilities btu related shorts that leverage upon our existing gas contacts would seem to be our greatest inherent advantage vs our competition also it could focus our fuel oil and middle distillate group on the opportunities between gas and liquids The relationships have never been closer and this seems to be a situation that could remain for a long time the u s presents more opportunites but we are making good progress in developing financial hedging business in europe with continental gas and I m pushing the origination groups in Europe to look into the physical supply opportunities 3 systems I m going to spend sometime with Brent Price tomorrow but my conclusion on doing the post mortem on Spain is that we need to resource the back office significantly before we can significantly grow the business They are struggling to keep up at the moment and the process seems very bureaucratic and inefficient This worries me because if you look at the problems that we have gotten into in the past we don t seem to have made great progress in eliminating the probability of there reoccurance now in terms of the situation with myself please put yourself in my shoes for a minute I have had no life for the last year sorting out the crap of others q1 helsinki q4 spain in the middle part of the year I had to spend much time addressing the people issues and other problems created by the vacumn of no managment in London for over a year Was able to coordinate a good profit on the gasoil books that was pissed away In addition I have had to take back over the book because ross was not capable of managing the short gamma position that was chopping him up the point being that managing didn t pay I have to run but these I want to discuss ","message_id":"<32779048.1075857549061.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-01-31

LON ECT ECT Carrie Southard LON ECT ECT Kevin McGowan Corp Enron ENRON Lenny Hochschild NA Enron Enron cc Subject Weekly Coal Report 29th Jan SUMMARY Atlantic Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm winter in Europe with a total of some 1 7 million tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of months As a consequence spot Q2 prices are now trading at 2 discount to replacement from South Africa 40 75 FOB ARA versus 42 75 replacement a concept which many are struggling to get their head round The Lion s share of the resell mkt is South African which makes sense as the strong U S mkt has taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline In truth while the U S mkt has been steaming only very limited incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U S as the Utilities only pay up for spot spot material If the steep backwardisation in the U S rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the strong U S domestic market will keep U S exports into Europe very low Pacific Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe over the last few months and this has been a function of the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to the consolidation which has been going on the latest development to be Rio Tinto s acquirement of Peabody s asset s in Oz We are currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz producers and the JSM s for pricing of their long term contracts It is not a secret that the producer s plan to go for broke and are looking to lock in prices above 30 FOB Newcastle currently wud call the mkt 28 50 JSM s are apparently holding tight citing world economic slowdown At 28 the oz producer is making some 13 a tonne the chinese are due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel production is forecast to be down some 10 year on year while we may see some activity at higher prices in the short term I think it will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are talking longer term China is also talking prices of 30 which is 3 4 higher than last year but have some 3 frt advantage versus Newcastle Gameplan We are currently a total of 2 4 million mt short ARA 1 million API2 1 4 million SECA with the bulk being in back end of this year We will continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has some further downside from where we are today the mkt has merely sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices if the stock situation does not improve in ARA currently a 13 day lineup in Rotterdam There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a significant impact We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the Armada of coal which is due to arrive Psychology shud create downward pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to buy in some our deferred short sub 30 RBCT equivalent Meanwhile we are working to sell 3 5 year agreements with several utilities while the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range We are also talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward In the Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering anything further forward Rgds Jez ","message_id":"<23113471.1075857549713.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-01-29

Subject Re What happened Here s a story as I was waiting at the bus stop 7 35am to go to school a lady approached me and asked if I d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus The mother was running late for work and could not wait I couldn t say no so Nicki the little girl 10 yrs old and I waited for the bus It was now 8 15 and there was no sign of her bus On top of things I had quiz at 8am Which I then realized I missed I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts I called her grandmother and explained things to her Pretty strange aye A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her but I couldn t do it Finally I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school 8 30am There were only 15 minutes left of class I stayed for the remainder of the lecture After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived I told the bus driver where to drop her off I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe

the Penn Alum Network Sorry if this email is a bit long I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am highly interested in applying for it But I would like to ask your advice regarding the approach I should take When I was an undergraduate at Penn Wharton CAS I started my own fertilizer trading company With zero capital and zero contacts in the industry I built up a company with 15 mil in revenues and clients all over the world I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra Transammonia Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe Six years ago outside factors forced me to join my family business which is in the entertainment industry Now I am at a point where I can and want to return to what I originally did The Enron position describes the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company selling to large commercial and industrial customers That is exactly what I did and did well But I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway producer is applying for the job Do you happen to have any suggestions Perhaps you might know someone in the New York office that I can meet with I am very interested in working for Enron and know that I posses the right skills I would greatly appreciate your advice Thank you Rina

Jeff During my assessment of your machine I noted your current hardware configuration SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors 512MB RAM Matrox Quad video card We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these specifications Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or better than the machine the customer has currently then swap that hardware The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 2000 Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock here is what I propose Every machine we migrate is Ghosted By this I mean we run a program called Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state This image can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other data I propose we Ghost your existing machine make a backup copy of that image after verifying it works correctly then re use your current hardware with Windows 2000 The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT your current system as quickly if something does not work If you would like to move ahead with this plan please let me know Otherwise we will order a machine with the same specifications but it will take some time to get here I look forward to hearing from you Regards Mike Hernandez Project GEM 713 853 7740

CABC reports contain sensitive information and are not for general distribution The Saudi oil minister is now saying that if Iraqi export volumes do not return to normal as assumed in the recent OPEC production cut OPEC might actually increase output at the March meeting This seems to reflect fresh doubts about Iraq s speedy return to the market Despite reports that loadings are resuming at Ceyhan our sources believe that Iraqi export volumes are likely to remain below normal levels These sources assess that Iraq is continuing to insist on the surcharges Some companies will steer clear of any Iraqi oil others will try to find a way to resume exports without being accused of paying a surcharge In any case it will be difficult for Iraq to ramp up to 2 mb d by Feb 1 as projected by a SOMO official at the OPEC meeting last week Bayoil has reportedly signalled that Iraqi exports are likely to resume normal levels by the end of the month However sources advise that Bayoil is considered to be an unconventional player compared to the traditional major lifters of Iraqi crude and it is an especially aggressive buyer of Iraqi oil It may be willing to do business with Iraq sooner than the more established players Therefore it might be incorrect to assume that firms are ramping up Iraqi liftings across the board based solely on indications from Bayoil Iraq averaged around 600 000 b d in December According to news reports 13 mb of Basra Light and 4 mb of Kirkuk have been exported so far in January

STRONG BEARISH FUNDS LACKING FOR RETENTION The Finance Minister Prijadi Praptosuhardjo IS saying that the government has no money to finance the retention plan According to a source close to AEKI the government has not contacted the association at all Another possible sore point is the interest rates charged by the banks for coffee retention So far there has been no indication that favorable interest rates will be extended to AEKI Some are concerned that the rate will be higher than that charged by the private banks Due to the tension which exists on these issues AEKI has threatened the government that if the money is not chanelled before April they will release 10 500 tons of coffee in their retained stock from the warehouses in Lampung and Medan There are people who believe that 10 500 tons is just the tip of the iceberg There is more than 7 500 tons in stock in Lampung alone according to an important domestic farmer in Lampung who is close to our source In fact the farmer estimates that Lampung itself has more than 10 000 tons and there are another 4 000 to 5 000 tons in Medan VIETNAM COFFEE STRONG BEARISH VIETNAMESE DUMPING PHANTOM STOCKS IN NEIGHBORING MARKETS Our

Upon investigation our source learned that it is true that there are some excess stocks stored in Vietnam He was informed by a source that the Vietnamese plan to release the stocks into Cambodia and also China to sponge up the excess supplies They command a fixed price in the black markets of those countries and provide much needed foreign exchange to the Vietnam government The secondary source said that this is common practice for Vietnam and they have done this for other cash commodities like Cashewnuts The source does not know the exact figures but estimates the excess to be 30 000 to 40

Hi Drew hope the London digs are working out I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately Today we let Britta Dinndahl go Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a termination She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and email people telling them about her termination I understand from Chris Mahoney that neither Nigel nor Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this today even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming termination It wasn t until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to tell him of her termination when she was taken off system access In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen s contract for over three weeks and has not produced paper for Erik to sign It was my hope to have him under contract before the bonus period Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London and on three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter to him today It took three weeks Obviously these are extremely serious lapses and I do not want Yvonne involved in any more Enron Global Markets Cindy and Shanna have done a heroic job for us in the U S and they have been extremely frustrated with their counterparts in London Thanks for addressing this issue Jeff

jeff long time no talk on lng shipping matters during the xmas new year period we discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping the best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co they control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels the lng shipping market is so inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under utilized the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet at marginal cost plus small margin this would enable us to ask them to give us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo no capital outlay no take or pay obligation win win situ as mosk would then make money that s their incentive out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term comitment on the shipping front mosk being japanese in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details at lower level in mosk the idea is known

A Shankman HOU ECT ECT Scott Tholan Corp Enron Enron Brendan Fitzsimmons NA Enron Enron Subject Venezuela LNG Randy Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and conclusions of the CABC Group s analysis of the questions you asked about the political and regulatory situation in Venezuela He expressed a number of areas of concern some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its accuracy I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone and clarify any inaccuracies We will revisit with our sources to clarify the following issues 1 Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it address gas hydrocarbons What details are available on the proposed law 2 If the new law does affect gas will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas Law 3 Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation distribution and upstream or will there be a single unified tariff Is there a dispute between PDVSA and the Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be handled 4 What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas Will it be affected by the new HydroCarbons Law 5 What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project between the government and foreign operators Once we have revisited with sources I told Emilio that we will be happy to correct any subsequent errors However if we reconfirm the information in the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting Emilio and I disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda while agreeing in others Also because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written we can only go on what sources in country are saying Clearly we have conflicting information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time to conduct further follow ups As I have said to both you and Emilio the CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal but rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC Hopefully these next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner RJ ","message_id":"<13123587.1075857552685.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-01-10

understand there is some concern regarding the take or pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas First there is no direct Enron Corp exposure Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities I met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India We have delayed the contractural start date under both contracts to the maximum extent possible February 11 2002 for Oman and April 30 2002 for Adgas What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer I will be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further My phone number is 505 336 8400 Clay

traders I had asked the traders two weeks ago to clean up the book as much as possible as we approached year end so that we could break up the book easily in early january unfortunately they have not done this and I had instructed all of the london distillate traders koller o brien talvitie today that if they wanted any positions they were to let me know by the cob today because I would be liquidating the book this week the only thing I insisted they take is the otc diff swaps that are traded for the physical bbls they are all assigned to trade in the case of ross these are large positions but the back office is making those changes tonight and we can see what the var of those positions is tomorrow the 1 million var limit for london distillates we will need to calculate by the sum of their 3 positions in regards to the book presently under ross I will get that down to 1 mil var but ask that you give me weds and thurs to get this done I will try to get this all done by tomorrow and had been reducing the positions today I would like to get a var for the global distillate book and will assume for now that the 1 mil will be for the 3 london traders I will assume ownership of all of those positions in the koller distillate book from now on so that these these guys and ross specifically can clear their heads and start over with as close as possible to a clean sheet of paper I made if very clear to them that starting over was a question of rebuilding credability and they should take great efforts to ensure that any positions they liked was put on at a low risk entry point and with small volumes to get some of the losses clawed back from friday though I would like to make you aware that this book has about a 3 5 million dollar climb to just get back to

Power Desk Jeff It is my understanding that you will be speaking with Simon Greenshields at Morgan Stanley MS tomorrow I have outlined the facts as I know them in regards to our position with PG E Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC has four outstanding purchases from PG E Energy Trading Power LP PG E One of these transactions PG E has backed with a purchase from MS We have not been disclosed exact terms of the transaction PG E has with MS The terms of our transaction with PG E are as follows EEMC purchases 100MW around the clock 1 1 2001 to 12 31 2002 from PG E with delivery point of SP15 at price of 29 Mwh This transaction is currently in the money 130mm We are proposing to assign EEMC s position to EPMI and then EPMI would agree to take assignment from PG E its position with MS in return for unwinding EPMI s transaction with PG E Our net book value would remain unchanged but we would transfer credit exposure to MS rather than PG E It is my understanding that MS is currently posting margin to PG E above some threshold within the Master contract between PG E and MS With the assignment EPMI would assume the contract under its Master agreement The current agreement has no executed margining agreements but we have been exchanging margin above a 15mm bilateral threshold Enron would be willing to either not require collateral on the deal or take the collateral under the current terms negotiated but not yet documented If we choose to take collateral MS can post either cash or letters of credit If they post cash EPMI contractually can invest those funds as we see fit but will be required to pay interest at the Fed Funds interest rate Give me a call if you have any questions Bill

month Thank you for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation I am enjoying the new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new technologies and business plans We recently came up with the idea of creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in Houston whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy industry could be outsourced to the Houston Technology Center and therefore benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town These idea labs would be set up as separate companies and would only require funding from investors such as Shell Exxon Mobil and the likes I assume that Enron would not be particularly interested given its own internal entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such new ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might want to invest in This idea was just recently floated and no real steps have been taken in any direction which is why I am wondering if I can ask you for your opinion Please let me know of any questions you might have

meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues involving my performance and status in the group I believe that I have applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results in my book and for the group My portfolio is up 6 7M YTD 12 17 00 which represents a significant contribution to the group s total revenues this year The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC process as sub standard and worthy of demotion I do not believe that this is just and would like to get this issue addressed As a result I would like to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12 17 00 for your review I have done this only because I know your position as President COO of Global Markets grants you access to this information Regards Brando PS Mark has just passed by to tell me you can meet in January However I would still like you to have this message ","message_id":"<22768771.1075857556485.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2000-12-18

Freight weekly report Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51 2000 Highlight The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers Fuel Oil helping the slide as they have lost approx 30 in the last couple weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less Panamaxes have on the other hand started a slow upward trend Most bundits think that this latest rise might be the dead cat bounce The Japanese buyers and the US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks while arguing over starlink which is basically genetically modified crops while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news of resumed shipping When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed and the panamax market quickly reversed trend and starting going up With the Christmas season quickly approaching we expect the market to slow down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining positions quickly This is the last report in 2000 Have a good holiday and see you next year Market Short term Medium term Long Term Handy Max Down Down Down Panamax Up

I know you re busy so here are my thoughts The hedge fund business has expanded enough to warrant at least two people covering it It makes sense that Enron has one person focussed on the natgas business since it is 90 of what we book right now We re also about to get one of the funds trading power Caroline Abramo focusses on this and will continue to do so reporting to Fred If for some reason that relationship doesn t work out we can revisit it with her at that time To build up the crude oil and products trading we should have a similar person devoted to covering the hedge funds That person should work for GM and work in partnership with ENA kind of a JV between our groups but with the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit as you plan to do Given that I would recommend putting Russell Dyk in that role have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick start the coverage and then move him to NY He and Caroline would share the hedge fund client base and back each other up when busy or travelling If we need more support we can add an associate to work for them jointly in NY Overall we re leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more origination income for Enron This model also fits with the reality of hedge fund coverage at Enron i e you need marketers with specific product knowledge close to the trading desks dealing direct with the fund traders Enron Metals has their own people doing this today We re simply expanding the concept to GM Ultimately when we get Enron under one rough in NY the metals oil and gas specialists woukld be able to jointly cover the clients while providing market expertise as needed If you agree this makes sense then I can tell Fred that we plan to put our own

using the brokers Today there are companies who will not turn on our system despite personal visits and other marketing They seem to prefer speaking to brokers b We could gain neutrality if the broker could transact on EOL on behalf of the customer The biggest problem when I speak to customers seems to be that by dealing with Enron on EOL the customer is afraid of giving us to much of information of what they are doing c The brokers are scared for the future They think they are about to die out due to electronic trading Enron should be able to strike a good deal with the broker Maybe even get

Discuss our Vision for the collection 2 Introduce Ned and Barry 3 Describe art locations in outside the buildings 4 Discuss progress made to date and timetable 5 Discuss the process To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the decision process going forward i e is he comfortable approving our Vision and having us implement Or does he want veto power on each piece The latter would be cumbersome and I personally would prefer the former but we definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed Questions right now for you 1 Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting 2 Ned cannot make it that day first available day is Dec 18th so should we postpone Barry is a maybe Remember they are there to help us shape a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any purchasing mistakes 3 I have a first draft of the presentation when can we meet to discuss it Following on our last meeting with Gensler I am assembling a detailed list of potential art locations by floor including dimensions when possible so that we have a Master from which to work I will run it by Bonnie McCloud and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy Lastly I have asked Bill Viola the video artist for the work we are considering to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to discuss where his piece might fit in the new building I have also placed a call Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to meet with a wonderful up and coming artist Olafur Eliasson who would like to propose a water piece for the circular drive You will recall that Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there Eliasson is very well respected and innovative He s created waterfalls that flow up and wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful I ve asked his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in Houston on their next trip Lastly Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging

Japan Latest overview from our regular Tokyo source RJ 1 Mori 01 s eventual resignation shouldn 01 t have much impact on the Ja panese 20 economy or yen dollar beyond a brief knee jerk reaction Regardless of the new 20 government 20 it seems clear Miyazawa and his surrogates will continue to control economi c 20 policy 20 and the figurehead nominally in charge of things doesn 01 t really matter 20 2 The bottom line is the Japanese are itching for another joint interventi on The weak euro is hurting Japanese export sales in the euro zone and beyond and they would like to draw a line in the sand near 85 euros to the dollar and 92 yen to the euro Problem is the United States 01 in the person of Larry Summers 01 wants intervention used only as a tool of last resort a nd only when central banks can use the element of surprise to spook market players into euro buying and maximize the bang for their buck 3 Will the Bank of Japan participate in another round of massive euro buyi ng Yes but only when the U S participates in full measure At what level wil l that multilateral intervention next occur Very difficult to say If the Japanese and some in Europe had their druthers they would have been in ther e this week Most analysts say the market has drawn a line in the sand at 80 euros to the dollar and if the central banks let the euro sink below that level they 01 ll have a devil of a time getting it back up Our judgement is that they have to act above 80 To try to narrow our prediction beyond that would I think be foolhardy 4 As to yen dollar we see some further yen weakness ahead for several 20 reasons The wave of bankruptcies in Japan shows no sign of abating And they 01 re getting bigger with Kyoei Life 01 s demise the largest yet 4 5 trillion y en While big bankruptcies are inevitable and some see a silver lining because Japan is finally trimming the dead wood from its economy the effect on market sentiment has been grim The Nikkei remains lost in a dark dark woo d for that reason and in sympathy with the NASDAQ Oil prices and the events in the middle east are also dollar positive on balance because of the flight to quality and the fact that much of the world 01 s oil is denominated in dollars And the Japanese first half repor ting season ended Sept 30 taking away a big incentive for exporters to repatriate dollars So we see a somewhat weaker range for the yen over the near term 01 let 01 s call it 108 112 with a bias towards the bottom of that range There 01 s s ome heavy resistance to the dollar around 111 73 this year 01 s peak So whil e the dollar might poke through 110 some time soon the bulk of trading should be in the 108 109 range Longer term rising profits on the export and high tech sectors and continu ed strong capital investment will pull the economy slowly out of the woods An d we continue to look for a stronger yen next year 5 On BOJ policy don 01 t look for another rate increase any time soon Th e BOJ took a lot of flack for the timing of its August increase and they made the ir political point about independence Our outlook is for an even keel on monetary policy near term No change at least through the end of this year 6 Technology notes Japanese semiconductor makers are set to announce stro ng earnings growth in the year ended Sept 30 NEC Toshiba Fujitsu Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric chip divisions will all report operating profits up between 20 percent and 60 percent 01 And you may have seen where four Japanese companies 01 Matsushita Electri c Toshiba Sony and Hitachi are entering into another venture to create interactive broadcasting and storage datacasting 01 eventually producing advanced TV set top boxes STBs These are the next generation boxes that turn TVs into computers enable

suggest we move to traders telling what the main positions are in their books 3 max and then give a bullish max 2 to bearish max 2 view of their mkt If we moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful discussion at the end I think that the discussion at the end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody to do a review of that In terms of the wed meeting unless there is something special I would recommend letting the new research analyst we have hired in London do a quick API review The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for lowering position sizes but the issue of not having any money to lose won t ever go away I base that statement on the premise that with the budget for next year set at 175 million we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any profits The books that have historically made the most money in enron global products have been more spread trading view oriented rather then flat price momentum oriented I know you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but I would encourage you to consider the fact that we have little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have enough staying power and experience to position ourselves correctly for the big moves From

to do their day trading with us I would think getting the small specs on our system would give us much greater daily deal flow On the oil side our main counterparties are the large speculative trading shops and this reflects that it is mainly proprietary traders that we are attracting at this stage Not sure how realistic this is from a credit perspective but if we could create some type of margin

the sweet crude produced by the plant The synthetic crude produced by this plant has no bottoms All other crude oils have at least some bottoms therefore the demand on the replacement blending barrel will be higher than the volume of barrels lost With the plant production down approximately 3 5 to 4 0 millions barrels the impact ultimately will be an increase of wti demand during the Oct 15 nov 15 approaching 130 000 b d Given the tightness of light sweet crude oil in padd 2 I believe this is significant I think it was the main reason for x z strengthening and the recent strength in z f may also be attributed to this recent supply disruption Until there are additional sweet barrels arbed into padd 2 from padd 3 I think we will see strength in the prompt spreads

ECT cc Subject Update I am pleased that Jason Fischer is doing a fine job as he took my place in the role of checking out NYMEX trades and formulating new relationships with brokers One of the key aspects of this job was moving trades to brokerage houses with credit financing available at no cost Basically the brokerage houses want to capture the brokerage fees in volume and believe that they are able to not worry about charging for the credit lines I d like to meet you with about this An contact of mine in accounting and I developed a spreadsheet see attached Xpit analysis to measure how much we are able to save by these movements Also according to the accomplishments list you ll notice that because of our actions on Fri Oct 13 directed by John Wilson in Products only for CL HO and HU we were able to see an instantaneous change from paying out millions each day to the numerous brokers to having millions of dollars wired to us by the brokers One of the critical functions of my former job was to manage the positions of all futures and options for all commodities From my experience in working closely with the traders we discovered especially on Friday October 13 that moving positions to brokerage houses with credit financing dramatically reduced our margin expenses thus increasing our daily cashflow in our wired brokerage accounts Most of September and the week of Oct 9 had negative cashflows In addition I worked with our global finance group Sarah Wesner to increase existing lines and open other lines of credit at other brokerage houses This action provided we monitor this vigilantly and remind the traders on a frequent basis to stay focused on clearing trades with houses that have financing will save Enron millions of dollars everyday Our treasury group Mary Perkins is pleased with this type of financing approach as we are using the additional money to reduce Enron s short term debt I have informed my former group esp Jason Fischer of the tremendous value which my prior function may add to Enron s financial well being It is this type of proactive thinking and creative financing that I hope to generate in my next rotations Currently I am in EnronCredit com Furthermore now that I am in the analyst program I d like to discuss with you in the late summer early fall for rotation opportunities Thanks David 3 3528

continue to be sideways and choppy weather fundamentals don t exist and nothing else will be fundamentally bullish or bearish enough to lead the market for the next several weeks Most people including the majority of our shop are getting bearish on the back of the builds we should have based upon iea supply demand predictions One concern here is that they have materialized yet over q3 If we look at the poor reaction to bullish news last week api stats unrest in the middle east I think it is safe to say that the sentiment in the market has turned bearish In general I want to go with the majority of the mkt but the rally that resulted when the violence erupted in the middle east two weeks ago shows the surprises will still be on the upside the way that we gave back all that ground reflects how little confidence there is in the mkt at the moment that these fundamentals last too much longer How many reports have you read lately about borrowed heating oil demand my back of the evelope calculations suggest that although this is somewhat true it only true for 150kbd in the winter vs an underlying demand of 4000kbd so maybe not such a big disappointment to come we still like being bullish distillate in europe for the winter but think that the mkt will be range bound on spreads and vs the complex until the need for winter coats comes along

example a particular week a calendar month the latest four weeks etc This would be in lieu of the more structured hard coded format in my e mail of yesterday I recommend this option Second the question How far back in time do you want to query 60 days 90 days There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report Each product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time bid price bid volume offer price offer volume All of this data will need to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query By limiting the amount of time the data is kept we

Further to your report Jeff If further conversations with our technical folks they have a suggestion which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question which helps determine the resources required to support it First the suggestion If the report is designed to run with a Start date and End date you will be able to pick the reporting period For example a particular week a calendar month the latest four weeks etc This would be in lieu of the more structured hard coded format in my e mail of yesterday I recommend this option Second the question How far back in time do you want to query 60 days 90 days There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report Each product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time bid price bid volume offer price offer volume All of this data will need to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query By limiting the amount of time the data is kept we can minimize the amount of data

previously spoke at They have suggested that Jeff speak on the topic of Joint Implementation JI and Clean Development Mechanism CDM as a business opportunity While Palmisano was focused on these

fielded two calls regarding the Euell Energy issue They are from Beth Evans at Platt s and Robert Givens at Bridge News They have both spoken with Renard Euell and asked for our side of the story Primary points made are as follows 9 28 or 29 Mr Euell contacted Enron through an employee in another division of Enron This contact was forwarded to John Nowlan through a second employee 9 29 Nowlan contacted Mr Euell and told him that if Euell receives part of the oil that Enron would talk to him about a possible deal Euell said he felt he would win part NOTE This was said in response to Beth s comment that Euell claimed Enron contacted him with apparent inside knowledge that Euell was going to win part of the bid 10 3 or 4 Euell called us regarding the SPR oil he won We asked for the particulars of his bid and he stated them to us 10 4 Enron received from Euell a copy of his letter to the DOE The details were different than Euell had told us but conversations continued 10 5 Enron faxed a draft Novation Agreement to Euell This was never executed In fact it has never left draft form 10 5 thru 9 Various conversations with Euell He claimed to be in conversations with Nigeria Shell Mobil BP Equilon Koch and Phillips 10 10 Enron spoke with Euell around noon and suggested he take another deal that Euell claimed to have Euell called Enron around 4 30 pm Enron reiterated belief that Euell should take the bid he claimed to have Interestingly Euell was in Houston supposedly having meetings with various companies but never requested a meeting with Enron nor did he ever have a meeting with Enron Both reporters prior to their conversation with me are convinced the guy is a flake And lay most of the blame for the SPR debacle on the back of the DOE Palmer plans to contact John

ventures I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions The one I enjoyed most was given by the ENRON Networks E Commerce group and its relationship with the Houston Technology Center This group was initially signalled to me by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who is also

development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T B as they have been on the Bahamas proposal However we came across a potential site in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site e g existing deep water port sufficient acreage adjacent to the port industrial zoning We have yet to test the rationale of injecting significant quantities of gas into that market location but the port is willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year In this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are committing to nothing and paying no dollars Please let me know if you concur The draft letter is attached below I ve got legal sign off on it already
