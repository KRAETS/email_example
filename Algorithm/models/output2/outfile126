applications associated with your business unit We expect to migrate Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week 4 4 4 5 As a former member of T S G TradeFloor Support Group EB31 32 I m well aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with Therefore I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of you going thru a profile process that should last no more than 10 15min Profiling can begin as early as today so here is what I ask of you Please reply to this e mail with your current location the number of PC s you have and the number of screens displays you have attached to each PC as well a date time that I can stop by Being that most of you sit in the same general location I m hoping this profiling process should take no more
