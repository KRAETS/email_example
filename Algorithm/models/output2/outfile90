walking the halls of Sacramento meeting with policy makers and advocating whatever plan the group develops Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for however long it takes to work out a resolution It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week and that it should take place in Sacramento It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible i e next week There was some discussion regarding the release today of Plan B Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison After that call I received a copy of Plan B If you d like a copy please send me your fax number Folks on the call agreed to have the next supplier only call in meeting on Friday Finally Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ratings agency level presentation prepared by the end of the week The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates The Agenda for Tomorrow s Call with the Governor s Staff Item 1 The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor s office wants to start tomorrow s meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue Hoffman said that the Governor s folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow s meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered If the draft is ready they d like to discuss on the call tomorrow Item 2 Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow s meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are The following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a starting point for discussion Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real time pricing implement demand buy down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power buying business as soon as possible e g once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness approximately 3 6 months Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18 24 months create a core noncore market structure for electricity similar to California s market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission generation etc Resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion Attached are the contact lists "},{"message_mailbox":"kean-s","received_time":"2001-05-15

and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour Am I understanding your position right Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract Will it help your business at all 2 California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of April Do you think this is the right decision How do you think you can set up a new competitive market Or won t you need such a market Will it be better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading 3 How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to California I understand you are very busy but I would really

California","recipient_address":"executive.committee@enron.com","message_body":"As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting below are some talking points for your use Overall message the market is working regulation is not In California peak demand rose by 10 over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2 But as you would expect the market responded by proposing 8 000MW of new generation more than enough to offset the peak demand growth The regulatory process at both the state and local level has failed to site this new generation The problem is regulation not deregulation When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels Enron s price was about 55 MWH After publication of Enron s offer nine other companies made offers Again the market responded where regulation failed San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX i e the spot market In markets where siting is easier suppliers have moved to build additional generation Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes Those plants were planned sited and built in less that 12 months in time for the summer of 1999 Where regulatory hurdles are lower the market responds The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation Policy makers should Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed Expedite interconnection of new generation Expedite siting of new facilities Give customers a choice so that they have better access to demand side solutions Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office "},{"message_mailbox":"kean-s","received_time":"2000-08-14
