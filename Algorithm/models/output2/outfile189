buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA If a customer goes DA after August 24 2001 based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy

and DWR net unavoidable The hardest piece to calculate which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn t given the tremendous uncertainty is the DWR net unavoidable If the customer has been DA since July 1 the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be the key question I d ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open Of course all of this assumes that the

indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed Gives EPSA an out of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC s application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable 2 I don t understand when EPSA says Our recommendation therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power on page 2 of the draft Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20 Economic Capacity test to FERC I would argue that 35 is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position Also is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in real time Having a once and done for three year application is ok but if we are conditioned that we can t get beyond 20 in any market what does this do to trading and how would this be reported 3 The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a bias against new entry is confusing Maybe we should clairfy our concerns 4 The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro competitive needs to be strengthened It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test Also it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant now 200 MW in a 500 MW market Maybe I am missing something 5 EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti competitive earlier in the paper This is my biggest concern that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market breaks even though our fundamental presence has not changed 6 I don t understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non RTO markets EPSA endorses something but I m not sure what What does this mean if I sell on TVA s network I appreciate blanket authority but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority Also doesn t this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don t want competition if they never set up an RTO they never face competition

and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier If you have any questions please call me Also Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG ARTO case not sure when this is due out Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond Please don t take this as a signal that we can t continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution Thanks Jim 1 Profit RTO Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state Stage III Stage IV 2 Regarding document Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission Does it imply that core for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process Wasn t the NETA design subject to an extensive consultation even for profit NG core functions 3 If each Transco manages it own OASIS how can we avoid fragmentation balkanization pancaking and many other negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate How can you achieve one stop shopping By outsourcing those functions to one single third party 4 As a follow up question what are the mechanisms to assure that this potential fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T particularly in important inter tie investments 5 What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco RTO Are you thinking about including external measures such as cost to provide ancillary services congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing 6 Are you envisioning an RTO Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested Or can the model live with a light RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not and sign an operating agreement with the RTO Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions page 9 still be robust under this scenario 7 Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP Congestion Management system based on financial rights Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool The UK system now looks like a self dispatch physical rights model 8 As a follow up of the previous question Assuming Alliance adopts a self dispatch physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today Don t you think that this will create significant barriers seams with other neighboring RTOs considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US 9 If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch LMP financial rights shouldn t some functions in your Martix of RTO Functions be collapsed For example management of congestion prices calculation of congestion operations of energy markets and generation redispatch 10 Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non core However in the UK system this represents a significant role of the Transco with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula 11 Generation interconnection Obviously your proposal did not go that far Conceptually do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs use of the system are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component and connection costs are treates separately according to a shallow method 12 Establishment of transmission rates How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates Are you thinking about some possible non regulated activities 13 You stated that separation and control of T assets persists to a large extent in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models","message_id":"<934178.1075855202624.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_subject":"Enron Questions on NG - ARTO"},{"recipient_address":"marchris.robinson@enron.com","received_time":"2001-11-21

issues presented in one place was very helpful To follow up on the meeting the following are action items for the group 1 December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting Thane Twiggs wholesale and Nancy Hetrick retail will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues or not with their respective areas We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting If anyone hears anything else about the market delay please let Jean Ryall know immediately As of right now it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled 2 Congestion Pass thru to EES Retail Customers Thane Twiggs Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal 3 Wholesale Issues Thane Twiggs a Define workable TCR Product b End Balanced Schedule requirement c Fix Capacity Auction process including credit matters d BENA OOM AS e Settlement Billing 4 Retail Issues a REP ISO Utility Interface Nancy Hetrick b Reliant PTB Pat Keene c TXU PTB Pat Keene d Reliant Negative CTC Pat Keene e TXU Negative CTC Pat Keene f EES EPMI License Gloria Ogenyi Nancy Hetrick 5 Information Flow All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity Also all people on the TO list above should be included on all e mail traffic I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest By having Jean Ryall in the center she will be able to ensure that no one feels cut out The bi weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner 6 Wholesale Products Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market Finally it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market This is our home base we need to make sure that our business efforts win big Thanks for everything ya ll have been

of argument is that the Refund process didn t ask the first question what or who is to blame It simply took dysfunction and ran We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question Also remember that we aren t going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year probably after SCE gets its money Finally I think that the right policy

get together and work up a discussion for all Government Affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon i e setting up good hubs and auctioning transmission rights Also I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important Not sure that either model is really great for competitive retailers The difficulty is that our predictions of

call Transelect Paul Buckman before our NG meeting You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG We are right now stuck between two very bad answers let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG Maybe Transelect has a better solution 2 Chief Issues with NG a are they really independent having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a market participant I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence b who do they feel the customer is maybe we want to get Paul Dawson s take on their business model from the UK it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders marketers and generators as their key customers what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want pass thru PBR etc c who writes the tariff I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little if any control over future changes the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints 1 must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and 2 must not damage the assets d do they intend to build own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business e how do they intend to provide balancing energy the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances what is NG intending to do on this issue does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO does NG support unbalanced uncovered schedules day ahead Also just to let people know Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward Please keep him included on the e mails Jim

Enron s submission of data into the Pacific Northwest PNW refund case The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16 The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following 1 Do we exclude bookouts ie only physical transactions It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case 2 Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases The ALJ s Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence our purchase would not be included in the data The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases By having the data in the case we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount 3 Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks through 24 hours through 7 days through one month through 1 year The ALJ s Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of spot deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC s Order The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply In addition it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and determine our trading strategies Weighing these risks I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance 4 Do we provide data based on contract date The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25 2000 through June 20 2001 This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows To minimize the hours on these transactions we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions I will call you this morning Thanks

that Impact 1 makes sense to present No real reason to set CTC 0 c kwh on Jan 5 CalPX was still in operation I think that Impact 2 better captures the idea Also probably not good to use the term CTC Eliminated Maybe should say CTC 0 c kwh Given the CPUC s March 27 Order the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31 2002 2 In calculating Impact 2 what did you use as the Jan 19 Aug baseline Did you calculate the hit of 104 5 from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline Also I assume that the Feb Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service 3 Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG E Adjustment Also may be interesting to have the impact of the PG E Adjustment the rate adjustment to re capture their previous mistake I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly 4 Should Impact 4 and Impact 5 apply to SCE s loads In column 4 it looks like it does SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge 5 Probably better to model Impact 5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1 6 Can you break out the volumes for vintage contracts versus retail gen with passthru contracts You haven t shown anything for a

action which is imminent while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC thus supporting the forces against competition Let s not study this too much we know what to do Move away from the commission Also I m not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill Finally I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry While Enron wants markets that work well the core problem is that we haven t deregulated enough not that markets aren t working Also I don t know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush Cheney plan came from I think it was an earlier document

again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge nerators may have withheld power the basic argument is that DEREGULATIO N ITSELF NOT FAIL RATHER IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED In addition the paper states that MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE S TO THE STATE S RESTRUCTURING PLAN BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE ELECTRICIT Y DEREGULATION In addition California s response of DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State s poor plan and actions created the financi al and political crisis The CBO finds that WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET because FEATURES OF THE RESTR UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out toge ther with our details of the policy failures This CBO report clearly und ercuts the political arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l ong term contracts but has
