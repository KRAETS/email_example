mail every Friday summarizing activities in the case for that week and what is coming up soon Nothing fancy or time consuming just a brief update For example Today 1 The court in California a ruled that Natwest does not have to disclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998 even about March 1998 disclosures and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of counsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and b deferred ruling whether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998 concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche I want to find out what this is about maybe Enron would be interested in such information 2 Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by Natwest to postpone the trial in California until September I don t think Natwest has much chance to succeed but they are going ahead I am not planning for ECT Securities to take a position 3 We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath s report after removing a big section discussing Hellmold s report in light of Tom Hatch s statement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT Securities Later this week Hellmold s deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say or not say about ECT Securities Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about

participate in the call last week because I thought it was only concerning financial consultants Shortly before the meeting a more detailed agenda arrived by e mail which may be par for the course but I find irritating Please find out 1 what was decided and 2 what is the agenda for tues Thanks J ROBERT NELSON JRNELSON LLGM COM 04 18 2001 12 57 PM To Richard B Sanders enron com cc CEKLUND LLGM COM Subject Power Exchange The Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday The list included PriceWaterhouse KPMG BDO Stonefield Josephson and Neilson Elggren The preference seemed to be PW in major part because it was actively involved in creation of the Power Exchange systems There was an obvious concern about the potential for conflicts given PW s role for the PGE committee In that regard we were told 1 that there is a different standard for accountants than attorneys 2 that counsel for the PGE committee didn t perceive a problem 3 that there would be different teams handling each of the cases 4 that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the underlying numbers ie that PW would at the same time be supporting and challenging numbers in claims litigation We ve asked PW for assurances that if there is any challenge it will be available to support the participants position We re waiting for a response For the moment no second choice has been identified Before the interviews I spoke with Marc Cohen He s frustrated with Joe Eisenberg Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer litigation responsibility to the participants committee Consequently Cohen went ahead and drafted a stipulation himself Evidently Eisenberg is about to sign off and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on shortened time I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to prepare a liquidating plan In that regard Eisenberg did go to the creditors committee and propose using 4 million of the 20 million of available cash to support a plan Not surprisingly the creditors came back asking for 18 million Cohen s sense is that there may be a deal in the 10 million range particularly if we can persuade the trade that the participants may themselves have a claim against the 20 million Cohen is giving thought to how we make that case If we can agree on a number we can get rid of the trade creditors shift responsibility for the wind up to a liquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case Cohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE committee He s concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a seat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as Enron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of Power Exchange participants Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that comes with that are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than encouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the PGE case Unless I hear to the contrary I ll assume that our position in that regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that particular issue we d abstain I see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to release collateral Is that something we d consider joining Bob Nelson This e mail including attachments contains information that is

strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation When we originally hired Greenberg we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 minutes 5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience Some in the group thought that they were the right choice over for example Andrews Kurth because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at FERC I clearly think we made the right call in this regard However at the time we made the choice I made the comment which I am sure all of you remember that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job If that happened to be Greenberg firm great but they would have to interview like the rest The fact that they have done research doesn t mean they get the job That research is transferable This is a billion dollar issue for the group Enron does not hire attys for

footnote regarding McCutcheon Doyle to indicate that the Committee will consider supporting an application under section 503 b While the Committee has not yet considered the question as you point out nevertheless we anticipate that McCutcheon Doyle s assistance will be very helpful in the prosecution of the commandeering litigation If that proves to be true as I suspect it will the Committee should not hesitate to support a section 503 b application on McCutheon Doyle s behalf at the appropriate time With respect to your second point one of the primary reasons discussed for the Committee s decision to hire the Greenberg Glusker firm was the strength of its litigation group its experience with inverse condemnation cases and the need to move quickly to control the commandeering litigation The Committee did discuss its concerns regarding the attorneys retained by the Debtor to handle the commandeering litigation but I do not recall any reservations or qualifications concerning Greenberg Glusker s prosecution of the commandeering matter During our Committee meetings Greenberg Glusker has already reported to the Committee the substantial time and effort it is devoting to the commandeering matter along with the McCutcheon firm Of course it goes without saying in any employment application that the Committee always reserves its right to change counsel or hire special counsel when appropriate Accordingly I see no reason to make any changes to the Greenberg Glusker employment application to address this point Please let me know right away if you disagree By copy of this email to the other Committee members I ask that they also let me know right away if they disagree Thanks for responding quickly

December 31 2000 Annual Report Please update the section of the disclosure for which you are responsible for inclusion in the first quarter 2001 Form 10Q Also please let me know if there are any new items that should be considered Please respond no later than Wednesday May 2 Gary 3 6841 14 LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES Enron is a party to various claims and litigation the significant items of which are discussed below Although no assurances can be given Enron believes based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established that the ultimate resolution of such items individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on Enron s financial position or results of operations Litigation In 1995 several parties the Plaintiffs filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston Texas against Intratex Gas Company Intratex Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company collectively the Enron Defendants each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex many of which have terminated Early in 1996 the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried or otherwise resolved separately In the first matter the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the Panhandle program a special marketing program established in the early 1980s This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants In the second matter the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs gas ratably with other producers gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988 The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims On March 9 2000 the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court s class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses including the statute of limitations The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to vigorously contest the claims Although no assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations On November 21 1996 an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan Puerto Rico The explosion resulted in fatalities bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property San Juan Gas Company Inc San Juan Gas an Enron affiliate operated a propane air distribution system in the vicinity but did not provide service to the building Enron San Juan Gas four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants along with several third parties including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Puerto Rico Telephone Company Heath Consultants Incorporated Humberto Vidal Inc and their insurance carriers in numerous lawsuits filed in U S District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico These suits seek damages for wrongful death personal injury business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and if so the lawful damages attributable to such injury The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards Numerous claims have been settled Although no assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations Trojan Investment Recovery In early 1993 PGE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility The OPUC granted PGE through a general rate order recovery of and a return on 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan The OPUC s general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC s order including the Utility Reform Project URP and the Citizens Utility Board CUB In August 2000 PGE entered into agreements with CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE s recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant Under the agreements CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29 2000 As a result of these approvals PGE s investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers either through a return on or a return of that investment Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29 2000 OPUC order With CUB s withdrawal URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of its investment in Trojan Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions Although no assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations Environmental Matters Enron is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron s financial position or results of operations Enron s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation

Sanders HOU ECT ECT Subject Roger Atkinson v Cogen et al Roger Atkinson v JEDI Linden and NEPCO This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter Cogen Technologies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the Atkinson matter in mid April I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy Company who had purchased ENA s interest in the Cogen companies effective late February 2001 El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter English to represent Cogen s interests We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters before and I have found him to be both effective and efficient This matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000 David Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this incident We will need to review NEPCO s contract with Cogen to determine if any such obligations exist The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and to Compel Inspection This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v Cogen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as Roger Atkinson v JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred I have asked Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or NEPCO To date we have not However I expect

case but that I would pass along his request I am concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a year ago to remove the pipe valve I asked him if he had any correspondence or other evidence of that He will check and get back to us Lisa Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land If we received notice and ignored it we may want to consider contributing to a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove intentional trespass However I still believe that Collins will have a difficult time proving any actual damages We need to be cautious about not getting into a situation in which Durango IP Petroleum would end up helping Collins to prove his case Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two weeks We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 17 Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial He sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories requests for production along with the notice of trial setting Lisa Robichaux will work with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information We also intend to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return July24 In the meantime if you agree I intend to file a motion for continuance since Durango would like one Collins did not give us notice of his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding honeymoon However we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not granted I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you have any questions Thanks Bonnie ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-07-07

know if there are any new items that should be consider ed Please respond no later than Tueday August 1 Gary 3 6841 3 Litigation and Other Contingencies Enron is a party to various claims and litigation the significant items o f 20 which are discussed below Although no assurances can be given Enron 20 believes based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 20 reserves that have been established that the ultimate resolution of such 20 items individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse 20 impact on Enron 01 s financial position or its results of operations Litigation In 1995 several parties the Plaintiffs filed suit in Harri s 20 County District Court in Houston Texas against Intratex Gas Company 20 Intratex Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company 20 collectively the Enron Defendants each of which is a wholly owned 20 subsidiary of Enron The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners 20 under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex many of which have 20 terminated Early in 1996 the case was severed by the Court into two 20 matters to be tried or otherwise resolved separately In the first matte r 20 the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 20 negligent misrepresentation in connection with the 01 Panhandle program 018 a 20 special marketing program established in the early 1980s This case was 20 tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants In 20 the second matter the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 20 state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 20 to take the Plaintiffs 01 gas ratably with other producers 01 gas at cert ain 20 times between 1978 and 1988 The trial court certified a class action with 20 respect to ratability claims On March 9 2000 the Texas Supreme Court 20 ruled that the trial court 01 s class certification was improper and remand ed 20 the case to the trial court The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs 01 20 claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses including the statut e 20 of limitations The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a nd 20 factual defenses and intend to vigorously contest the claims Although no 20 assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the se 20 matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o r 20 results of operations On November 21 1996 an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida l 20 Building in San Juan Puerto Rico The explosion resulted in fatalities 20 bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property San 20 Juan Gas Company Inc San Juan an Enron subsidiary operated a 20 propane air distribution system in the vicinity Although San Juan did not 20 provide service to the building the National Transportation Safety Board 20 NTSB concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin g 20 from San Juan 01 s distribution system San Juan and Enron strongly disagr ee 20 The NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan 01 s system to the 20 building and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion Enron 20 San Juan and four San Juan affiliates have been named along with several 20 third parties as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U S District 20 Court for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico 20 These suits which seek damages for wrongful death personal injury busine ss 20 interruption and property damage allege that negligence of Enron San Juan 20 and its affiliates among others caused the explosion Enron San Juan an d 20 its affiliates are vigorously contesting the claims Although no assurance s 20 can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 20 will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or result s 20 of operations Trojan Investment Recovery In early 1993 PGE ceased commercial operatio n 20 of Trojan In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County Oregon 20 found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its 20 undepreciated investment in Trojan contradicting a November 1994 ruling fr om 20 the same court The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE 01 s March 1 995 20 general rate order which granted PGE recovery of and a return on 87 of i ts 20 remaining investment in Trojan The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon 20 Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC 01 s March 1 995 20 order Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling 20 which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at 20 the Oregon Court of Appeals On June 24 1998 the Court of Appeals of the 20 State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG E 20 to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan 20 generating facility The court upheld the OPUC 01 s authorization of PGE 01 s 20 recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme 20 Court On August 26 1998 the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for 20 review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the 20 Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE 01 s recovery of its 20 undepreciated investment in Trojan On April 29 1999 the Oregon Supreme 20 Court accepted the petitions for review On June 16 1999 Oregon House Bi ll 20 3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate d 20 investment in property retired from service was signed One of the effects 20 of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC 01 s authority to allow PGE 01 s 20 recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati ng 20 facility Relying on the new legislation on July 2 1999 PGE requested the Oregon 20 Supreme Court to vacate the June 24 1998 adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou rt 20 of Appeals affirm the validity of the OPUC 01 s order allowing PGE to reco ver a 20 return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio n 20 accepting the Utility Reform Project 01 s petition for review The Utility 20 Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board another party to the 20 proceeding opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of 20 State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th e 20 new legislation on the November 2000 ballot The Oregon Supreme Court has 20 indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000 20 elections Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions Additionall y 20 due to uncertainties in the regulatory process management cannot predict 20 with certainty what ultimate rate making action the OPUC will take regardi ng 20 PGE 01 s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment Although n o 20 assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the se 20 matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o r 20 results of operations Environmental Matters Enron is subject to extensive federal state and 20 local environmental laws and regulations These laws and regulations requi re 20 expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities the 20 operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating 20 sites The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to 20 result in increased operating expenses These increased operating expenses 20 are not expected to have a material impact on Enron 01 s financial position or 20 results of operations The Environmental Protection Agency EPA has informed Enron that it is a 20 potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant 20 Site the Decorah Site in Decorah Iowa pursuant to the provisions of the 20 Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCL A 20 also commonly known as Superfund The manufactured gas plant in Decorah 20 ceased operations in 1951 A predecessor company of Enron purchased the 20 Decorah Site in 1963 Enron 01 s predecessor did not operate the gas plant and 20 sold the Decorah Site in 1965 The EPA alleges that hazardous substances 20 were released to the environment during the period in which Enron 01 s 20 predecessor owned the site and that Enron 01 s predecessor assumed the 20 liabilities of the company that operated the plant Enron contests these 20 allegations To date the EPA has identified no other potentially 20 responsible parties with respect to this site Under the terms of 20 administrative orders Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted 20 subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly 20 located Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November 20 1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999 20 Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA 20 Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with thi s 20 site Enron 01 s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 20 remediation on a number of their facilities Enron does not expect to incu r 20 material expenditures in

August 4 JB and I had a discussion re engaging Wisvest in a dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the San Antonio project In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8 2 00 Board meeting which was a we needed to finalize the numbers re the WMI royalty renegotiation b verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project c revise the project pro forma to reflect the revisions in a and b and d run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to accept in order to make the project economics viable In our phone conversation on 8 4 00 we again agreed this was the right course of action to take Subsequent to that call JB had conversations w Derek Price at Wisvest re prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re the project In another phone conversation on Monday August 7 I specifically asked JB whether he had sent the project pro formas and or other proprietary info to Derek Price to which JB responded no He said he sent him summary info but did NOT send him the pro forma I then asked him to forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek What he sent to me was some very basic e mails and financial summary info I also asked Derek to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more including the full blown project model pro forma This has seriously diminished all of our negotiating leverage On 8 10 00 I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in setting up a South American version of Ecogas Ecogas S A and called him to inquire as to what was going on In our phone conversation JB explicitly denied any involvement including any ownership in such an enterprise I also asked JB to forward to me by Friday 8 11 00 copies of any and all documents agreements etc relating to Ecogas S A To date he has sent me nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless correspondence undated and or old e mails etc None of the info sent is what I asked for on August 4 complete execution copies of the MOU regarding Ecogas S A including ownership interests etc as well as copies of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S A etc Who is Ecogas S A Where is it currently incorporated Who are the beneficial owners Under what authority are you transacting business what is your title etc JB continues to reference nothing has been signed incorporated etc then why is JB s signature evidenced on an Amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding Ecogas S A Tortola JCS JB referenced the need to directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness For the past couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets greenhouse gas emission credits etc To the best

talked about before and I wasn t sure how Enron would react to it but my own reaction was negative because Enron had no claims back against Natole other than financial offsets so I fail to see why it s necessary IBC is a different matter because IBC filed a counterclaim against Natole 2 Deen wants the Natole indemnity to be capped at the amount of settlement In other words Natole indemnifies Enron IBC from claims by Jung Ho or others only to the extent of 385 000 This again is not what we talked about but as a practical matter I m not sure how much difference it makes Everyone seems to view the

Connecticut I have included what I believe to be our standard ENA arbitration damages limitation provision that contains a provision stating that ENA and counterparty shall each designate an arbitrator who need not be neutral within 30 days after receiving notification of the filing for the demand for arbitration The originators on the transaction are adamantly opposed to the quoted language because it is not standard ENA arbitration language is an affront to our counterparty and could screw up the transaction if I insist leaving it in the document I have pointed out it is applicable to our and our counterparty s designee and is intended to ensure we get at least one sympathetic or at least knowledgeable participant on the panel that could be persuasive to the panel as a whole I also said I thought the deletion of the quoted language would give the counterparty the right to challenge a non neutral designee under the rules of the AAA and throw the whole designation

MG Metals Richard Marcus told me that wanted to refer to you and me the above referenced new MG Metals matter Briefly ICTS of Athens Alabama one of MG Metals shipping agents has reportedly gone into bankruptcy without paying about 80 000 owed to various motor carriers truckers for transportation here in the U S of MG Metal s aluminum No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone into bankruptcy MG Metals offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers demand letters for these freight charges some of which are from attorneys threatening suit These letters state that as consignee of the various cargoes MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges I think that this is generally correct as a matter of U S law given the usual motor carrier bills of lading although I am having this double checked Since we have already paid most but not all of the money we owed to ICTS MG Metals is looking at a double payment exposure Also even to the extent that ICTS has not been paid it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough to cover both ICTS s commission and the trucker s freight charges in other words a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS which amount should have covered both freight and commission I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is 15 000 Bob Klide of MG s New York office and Nicole Dion of MG s Canada office no relationship to Celine I asked will be shortly sending me their files To complicate things a bit more many of the letters Nicole has received deal with shipments made in March at a time when Nicole and her office were employees of a trading division of Barclay s Some time afterward they were acquired by MG Metals As a result of this Barclay s may depending on the agreement between Barclay s and MG Metals be on the hook for some of this liability Nicole advises she has place a Barclay s representative on notice I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like Obviously it is a small dollar case and we don t want to pay any money to anyone unless we absolutely have to Let me know Britt ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-09-20 11:01:00-07:00","message_subject":"Re: In re ICTS[MG

no objections melanie gray weil com 09 21 2000 05 38 PM To richard b sanders enron com cc Subject PCA Liz Austin our Connecticut counsel has been asked to represent Arizona Public Service Company and Griffin Energy Marketing both of whom have recently been sued by the PCA Trust As discussed below we do not believe that there is any adverse interest between Enron and these two companies but Liz wanted you to be comfortable with her concurrent representation of these two other defendants As I may have mentioned before many of the defendants in the joint defense group are represented by one law firm There is a commonality of interest in the defenses to the Trust s claims The complaint against Arizona Public consists only of preference claims in the amount of 300 000 and an objection to its 420 000 proof of claim Griffin Energy has been sued for breach of contract turnover unjust enrichment fraudulent transfer etc Total amount of claims equal 530 000 With Griffin PCA failed to deliver power in May and the Griffin terminated its contract with PCA before the energy spikes began to occur Liz has review the complaint against Enron and our draft answer and is aware of our issues and defenses None of our defenses would be in conflict with the defenses asserted by Arizona Power or Griffin If fact many of the same defenses would be raised Both Arizona Public and Griffin would agree that if any sort of issue conflict came up in the future or if Enron became otherwise uncomfortable with the concurrent representations Liz would withdraw from representing Arizona Power and Griffin and they will waive any right to assert a conflict or seek disqualification Assuming that Arizona Public and Griffin Energy are not otherwise adverse to Enron in other matters which Liz did not believe they were are you comfortable with these concurrent representations I believe that there may be some beneficial economies in the concurrent representations in that Liz s time at hearings involving all defendants etc would be split among the defendants However if you re uncomfortable then that s the end of the analysis Liz is waiting to get back to Arizona Public and Griffin so once you ve decided please let me know Thanks NOTE The information contained in this email message is intended only for use of the individual or entity named above If the reader of this message is not the

independent contractors driving their personal automobiles in discharging their duties if they do not procure the correct insurance we will be facing this issue in the future More specifically when an

Esq California Public Utilities Commission 505 Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California 94102 Re I 00 08 002 Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland General collectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year 2000 as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests 1 through 4 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1 1998 is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October 13 2000 Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1 4 will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staff s purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests 12 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either non existent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000 Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited In addition those transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are limited to sales to the ISO and PX and long term contracts with two small California municipal utilities Thus the Commission will receive the essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and PX Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests 13 15 16 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year 2000 in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI s customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13 2000 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October 27 2000 It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact

s Complaint As you have already heard California Municipal Utilities Association filed a 20 complaint with FERC asking for cost based rates The following is a brief 20 outline of an EPMI EES answer to the complaint The answer is due Friday 20 Please send me any comments ASAP 20 The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the 20 Commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to require 20 cost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems 20 currently faced by the California markets We should attach our white pape r 20 to our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could b e 20 solved at little or no cost to the customers 20 I list here for your information the reasons CMUA claims that markets a re 20 not competitive these reasons will not be re listed in the pleading 20 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load zonal constrained prices even in the off peak hours do not reflect 20 competitive outcomes for low load conditions 20 even small players can be price setters The changes required are additional generation transmission and demand 20 response and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periods 20 of time to implement There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates i n 20 the near future CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring the Commissi on 20 has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at 20 market based rates However CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wher e 20 there has been market based trading of electricity before electric 20 restructuring since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool 01 s 20 contract in 1991 The Commission 01 s rules didn 01 t create the wholesale market 20 in the past the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up by 20 certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper The 20 problem is not the market based rates The problem is the market rules CMUA 01 s motion does not address how market based rates would be calcula ted 20 for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources let alone 20 reflect the trading of basis points Almost all of the power EPMI sells is 20 power it has bought from some other marketer or generator Many of EPMI 01 s 20 deals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identit y 20 of the seller until after a deal has been struck Accordingly EPMI gets n o 20 information about the cost of the underlying generation 20 If FERC doesn 01 t try to fix the market but simply takes away our 20 market based rates since there 01 s is no basis for us to set cost based r ates 20 we would go out of business Besides there 01 s no reason to take away our 20 market based rates because we are not exercising market power So if FERC 20 could fix the problem with a less onerous solution as we 01 ve proposed in our 20 white paper requiring cost based rates would constitute a regulatory taki ng 20 of our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutiona l 20 standard 20 CMUA does not provide any expert testimony to support its position Rathe r 20 its evidence is 01 drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered b y the 20 California ISO and other public sources 018 Beyond the difficult evidenti ary 20 issue posed by the fact that CMUA cannot swear to the veracity of informati on 20 produced by third parties EPMI would have no opportunity to conduct 20 discovery or cross examine of such 01 witnesses 018 20

litigation the significant items o f 20 which are discussed below Although no assurances can be given Enron 20 believes based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 20 reserves that have been established that the ultimate resolution of such 20 items individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse 20 impact on Enron 01 s financial position or its results of operations Litigation In 1995 several parties the Plaintiffs filed suit in Harri s 20 County District Court in Houston Texas against Intratex Gas Company 20 Intratex Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company 20 collectively the Enron Defendants each of which is a wholly owned 20 subsidiary of Enron The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners 20 under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex many of which have 20 terminated Early in 1996 the case was severed by the Court into two 20 matters to be tried or otherwise resolved separately In the first matte r 20 the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 20 negligent misrepresentation in connection with the 01 Panhandle program 018 a 20 special marketing program established in the early 1980s This case was 20 tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants In 20 the second matter the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 20 state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 20 to take the Plaintiffs 01 gas ratably with other producers 01 gas at cert ain 20 times between 1978 and 1988 The trial court certified a class action with 20 respect to ratability claims On March 9 2000 the Texas Supreme Court 20 ruled that the trial court 01 s class certification was improper and remand ed 20 the case to the trial court The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs 01 20 claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses including the statut e 20 of limitations The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a nd 20 factual defenses and intend to vigorously contest the claims Although no 20 assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the se 20 matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o r 20 results of operations On November 21 1996 an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida l 20 Building in San Juan Puerto Rico The explosion resulted in fatalities 20 bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property San 20 Juan Gas Company Inc San Juan Gas an Enron affiliate operated a 20 propane air distribution system in the vicinity but did not provide servic e 20 to the building Enron San Juan Gas four affiliates and their insurance 20 carriers were named as defendants along with several third parties 20 including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Puerto Rico Telepho ne 20 Company Heath Consultants Incorporated Humberto Vidal Inc and their 20 insurance carriers in numerous lawsuits filed in U S District Court for t he 20 District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico These suits 20 seek damages for wrongful death personal injury business interruption and 20 property damage allegedly caused by the explosion After nearly four years 20 without determining the cause of the explosion all parties have agreed not 20 to litigate further that issue but to move these suits toward settlements or 20 trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the 20 explosion and if so the lawful damages attributable to such injury The 20 defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards Numerous 20 suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal 20 court beginning in February 2001 Although no assurances can be given Enro n 20 believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a 20 material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations Trojan Investment Recovery In early 1993 Portland General Electric 20 Company PGE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power 20 generating facility Trojan In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario n 20 County Oregon found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission OPUC coul d 20 not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in 20 Trojan contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court The ruli ng 20 was the result of an appeal of PGE 01 s March 1995 general rate order which 20 granted PGE recovery of and a return on 87 of its remaining investment i n 20 Trojan The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa s 20 stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC 01 s March 1995 order Both PGE and the 20 OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling which appeals were combined 20 with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals 20 On June 24 1998 the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th e 20 OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o n 20 its undepreciated investment in Trojan The court upheld the OPUC 01 s 20 authorization of PGE 01 s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja n PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme 20 Court On August 26 1998 the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for 20 review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the 20 Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE 01 s recovery of its 20 undepreciated investment in Trojan On April 29 1999 the Oregon Supreme 20 Court accepted the petitions for review On June 16 1999 Oregon House Bi ll 20 3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate d 20 investment in property retired from service was signed One of the effects 20 of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC 01 s authority to allow PGE 01 s 20 recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan Relying on the new legislation on July 2 1999 PGE requested the Oregon 20 Supreme Court to vacate the June 24 1998 adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou rt 20 of Appeals affirm the validity of the OPUC 01 s order allowing PGE to reco ver a 20 return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio n 20 accepting the Utility Reform Project 01 s petition for review The Utility 20 Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board another party to the 20 proceeding opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of 20 State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th e 20 new legislation on the November 2000 ballot The Oregon Supreme Court has 20 indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000 20 elections Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions Additionall y 20 due to uncertainties in the regulatory process management cannot predict 20 with certainty what ultimate rate making action the OPUC will take regardi ng 20 PGE 01 s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment Although n o 20 assurances can be given Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the se 20 matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o r 20 results of operations Environmental Matters Enron is subject to extensive federal state and 20 local environmental laws and regulations These laws and regulations requi re 20 expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities the 20 operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating 20 sites The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to 20 result in increased operating expenses These increased operating expenses 20 are not expected to have a material impact on Enron 01 s financial position or 20 results of operations The Environmental Protection Agency EPA has informed Enron that it is a 20 potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant 20 Site the Decorah Site in Decorah Iowa pursuant to the provisions of the 20 Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCL A 20 also commonly known as Superfund The manufactured gas plant in Decorah 20 ceased operations in 1951 A predecessor company of Enron purchased the 20 Decorah Site in 1963 Enron 01 s predecessor did not operate the gas plant and 20 sold the Decorah Site in 1965 The EPA alleges that hazardous substances 20 were released to the environment during the period in which Enron 01 s 20 predecessor owned the site and that Enron 01 s predecessor assumed the 20 liabilities of the company that operated the plant Enron contests these 20 allegations To date the EPA has identified no other potentially 20 responsible parties with respect to this site Under the terms of 20 administrative orders Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted 20 subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly 20 located Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November 20 1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999 20 Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA 20 Enron does not expect to incur any additional expenditures in connection wi th 20 this site Enron 01 s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 20 remediation on a number of their facilities Enron does not expect to incu r 20 material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-10-22

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission 505 Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California 94102 Re I 00 08 002 Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland General collectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6 2000 and October 18 2000 date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October 13 2000 Bate Nos Enron Entities 000001 000025 on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos 1 11 20 October 27 2000 Bate Nos P000001 002115 on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos 12 14 16 and 18 November 14 2000 Bate No Enron Entities 000026 Diskette with EES EEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos 7 to 11 13 15 to 17 and 19 November 15 2000 Bate No P002116 002117 Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate 355 000 wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos 7 to 11 13 to 17 and 19 We believe with these productions we have complied with the October 6 18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES EEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October 6th email available for production by October 27th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October 18th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commission s own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November 1 2000 Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commission s stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission s threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please

Hoecker s Questions FYI Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC s questions It is still missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting I believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego litigation In response to Question No 4 he is asking FERC to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption As a practical matter however our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti trust laws for example the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get FERC to make a finding If FERC does make the finding it will undoubtedly be appealed I do not know how to assess the likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis If we are going to go this route I would take out the conditional phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads if they were not in violation of market rules established under the ISO s and PX s tariffs Talk

taking the time to consider Felix Todaro s case I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would be safe in her care After a brief court case he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w his divorce from his second wife Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold I asked David Schwab Elizabeth Dodge husband at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me At the time Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee he has since left that job and now works at a garage making 500 gross per week He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current Shortly after their divorce his ex wife asked his permission to move to Iowa where her family lived Felix let her go He has not seen his daughter in two years Last month he heard that his ex wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa His mother in law denied him access Last month his ex wife died I wrote a letter to the mother in law asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist Obviously I am not in a position to help Felix but I was hoping

Subject Cuiaba Call legal issues 1 Consent Issue Jose Bestard he s the main developer who did this deal reported that he met with Furnas this week Furnas had not received EPE s letter addressing the consent issue Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE There are initials on the original consent and no one including Furnas knows whose they are John Novak told me he s not sure of the significance but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents Nevertheless we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor Electronorte 2 Arbitration considerations Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador He consulted Enron s financial business consultant in Brazil Winston Fernino sp who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration What concerns me however is his advice that politically it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent that there is a political battle in the senate and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance My view on that is to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default when the 90 day cure period has expired plus the 30 day extension which has also expired sends the wrong message and weakens our position Thus it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27 paragraph 2 of the PPA which then requires a 30day consultation period paragraph3 at the end of which we have the option to terminate This buys us a little time but keeps the pressure on at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate I m not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas I m not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet I am not sure what rights if any we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation something we need to look at under the contract although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard I committed that we would advise the team on the next call next Thursday our recommendation with respect to arbitration litigation I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that or handle that your own way Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative I ll find out who represents them 3 Force Majeure Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim Based on my reading of the contract our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95 c However I m told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms We ll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general s action Laine Powell President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months both parties have the right to terminate No one buys the plant and we re stuck I ll find out the date of our last FM notice There have been several 4 Budget Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and the cost of the arbitration Darren I ll call you tomorrow and we can break that out We may want to consider the litigation route We ll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it I ve done this with Pete before and he seems to like it It needs to be subject to review as we go along 5 NEXT Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place I m going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice We certainly have some conflicting views Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway If we go to court perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate that is what Fernando Serec said Who knows Please give me your comments or just call me I m open to any suggestions John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan Regards Michelle ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2001-02-04

collection action for about 1 800 000 of unpaid spot gas sales against Triad a very small company whose address or at least one address is in Columbus Maryland The unpaid sales deals began around February of 2000 All the deals were made over the phone by the trader and then confirmed with ENA s spot gas sales forms confirms Per ENA s usual custom and practice neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms although there are signature lines ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these deals Triad paid off some other deals but has since stopped sending us any money I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 2000 Triad s principal Sherwood Purnell has apparently admitted in a recorded telephone conference that he would pay us Our information is that Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms we have sent an arbitration demand to Triad Triad did not respond The AAA has sent out a list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 7 I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an extension for Purnell and left a message that I want to discuss the case This was on Monday I have also had Becky my legal assistant call up Triad s registered agent for service of process although the Maryland secretary of state s office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told Becky a he was still the right party to receive service of process and b he was aware of us This leads me to believe that the address that we have been using is a good address We did get someone to sign for documents that we sent to that address What I don t want to do however is go all the way through arbitration get a default judgment then when we try to enforce it have Triad complain that we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen day extension of time within which to send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any other address that looks viable by Federal Express or certified mail so that we get a receipt So long as we get the registered agent to sign for these things I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding Giving Triad an extension of time to answer also makes us look good Parenthetically unfortunately given Triad s attitude I think it likely that after we get an arbitration award Triad will choose not to abide by it until at a minimum we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award enforced I don t see a way around that problem Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time Britt Thanks Britt ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2001-02-04

the potential bankruptcy of PG E It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in any proceeding then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to our firm confidential information In particular if Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity litigation including class actions governmental investigations and the recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG E for physical delivery our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron even against the City of Palo Alto One of the reasons that the City of Palo Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized expertise of Larry Engel The City of Palo Alto has its own generation capacity through WAPA the Western Area Power Administration NCPA the Northern California Power Agency and TANC the Transmission Authority of Northern California The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron as I understand it We have specifically identified the City and County of San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of

pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor Wilde Construction last May near Luling TX Citgo has incurred aprox 700k of cleanup costs We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo for failing to correctly mark the line Wilde for negligently striking the line and Bechtel for not being present as our construction manager knowing that Wilde was working near the gasoline line The new complication The spill may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000 odd acres parcel affected by the spill If that purchase doesn t go through the attorney for the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be foreclosed and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase price 1 3MM which I doubt he could fully recover since he could sell the property for some lesser amount I am setting up a mediation of Citgo Bechtel and Wilde where John Odam our atty with Mangham Hardy would act as mediator The new info about the land claim may change that strategy

desire to have all our ducks lined up to avoid the additional 4 5 million funding Although this amount is not huge by Enron standards in this case any further funding has no chance of recovery and would be an immediate writeoff As you know this project has had extremely high visibility We need to leave no stone unturned Thanks Dick John Enerson ECT 02 14 2001 02 16 PM To Richard B Sanders HOU ECT ECT cc Richard Lydecker Corp Enron Enron Subject Can Fibre Lackawanna I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement The Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in full the Subordinated Lenders thats us can not accelerate foreclose etc There is not 180 day period There is nothing Nonetheless this does highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to weigh our options and strategy This is specially true for matters with respect to the Construction Completion and the additional 4 5 million that remains unfunded The letter of credit backing the 4 5 million obligation expires on June 30 2001 At that time we have an argument that we will not replace the letter of credit and because they are in default we are not going to fund I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared An analysis would include 1 Review of the applicable conditions to fund the 4 5 million and make sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement In particular since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract we want to make certain that no rights have been waived Also we want to put them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications 2 Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the current default 3 Understand our obligations The loan agreement requires us to fund 4 5 million upon completion regardless of the posting of the letter of credit By being in default does that provide us a defense to funding Can they cure the default and make us fund What does bankruptcy do to this scenario Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues

B Sanders Esq E mail richard b sanders enron com Subject Document Retention Tim Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of hard copies of documents IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents While most of what we do is contained within Enron s electronic systems there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents 1 The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI s business of selling energy in the WSCC you must keep those documents until further notice If space becomes a problem please contact who can arrange for storage 2 What constitutes a document In some instances you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it and another copy that may be clean For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved Similarly if several people have copies of the same document each separate copy is considered a separate document On the other hand if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used If you keep handwritten notes for your work those would be considered documents as well Telephone notes charts printouts of data spreadsheets etc all constitute documents If you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should be saved please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall 3 The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale electricity market litigation If hard copy documents are discarded at a later point in time EPMI and or its employees will be criticized for failing to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation 4 Personal documents such as shopping lists personal messages from friends unrelated to the energy business etc are not covered by this policy and you may do with them as you wish Tim if you have questions about this policy please call me Thanks Gary This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient s and may contain confidential and privileged

the ISO in a segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court I think we all would agree that the money belongs to ISO creditors and that the PX has no claim on these funds My guess is that the PX would like to have this money so that it can deduct administrative expenses from it If I can provide more information on this let me know Steve

asking alot Easter sounds good to us There was a chance that Maury s sister was coming but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes so cancelled We will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to I think it will be at 1 00 so we will plan to be gone on that day Which will give some breathing room for whoever is there There is this huge egg hunt at the Episcopal Diosese which is where Maury s mom works and I hear it is better than any country club egg hunt Just fun So we will go there and come back for the night When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals I would be happy to grocery shop for everyone and split it down there What do you feel like having Anyway I will talk with you later

Peter Crilly LON ECT ECT Subject CATS litigation Disappointingly the House of Lords ruled 5 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately 150 million plus interest and court costs putting the final figure at an estimated 155 160 million We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says The opinion seeks to conclude what rational businessmen could have intended rather than applying the provisions of the contract For example Lord Hoffman author of the primary opinion makes it clear that the retrospective consequences of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made and would therefore need to be refunded are unacceptable His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J Block gas during the period of the T 6 leak we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract Furthermore he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7 5 Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J Block field The contract makes no reference to this requirement Hoffman s view is that it is only upon tie in that the CATS parties obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie in is complete This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman s earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue As you may recall restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister our other counsel have assessed the opinion as appalling and pathetic and describe the situation as one where Enron has been stitched up Unfortunately given that this is the court of last resort in this country except of course the Court of Human Rights there is not an avenue for recourse In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years The case has been a roller coaster ride I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion My telephone

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT As many of you probably know by now our chargeback case is scheduled for next week s FERC agenda Thus if its not too late already it is imperative that we file our answer to the PX s answer ASAP In this regard no party filed a reply yesterday in opposition to the PX s motion to the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay It is my understanding that a proposed order is circulating among applicable bankruptcy counsel If all counsel sign today the PX intends to file it with the court tomorrow and we could conceivably get an order from the court tomorrow modifying the stay I am advised however that if not all counsel are available to sign the proposed order today the PX intends to simply file the proposed order with the court tomorrow In this event under local rules the court must wait seven days before entering an order modifying the stay Of course this will be after FERC s meeting next week Assuming that an order is not issued tomorrow the question for the group is whether we should file our answer tomorrow in any event The theory would be that since the debtor itself sought to modify the stay so as to permit litigation of the chargeback proceeding to continue no party opposed the motion and the debtor filed a proposed order with the court to modify the stay any violation of the automatic stay would be technical at best and unlikely to be raised by the PX in the bankruptcy proceeding This argument would be enhanced if the PX requests the court when it eventually enters its order to do so retroactively to April 6 I would like to hear from the parties including bankruptcy counsel whether they endorse or oppose this approach Thanks Ron P S if you are aware of any members of our group

Zikes Corp Enron ENRON Becky Stephens Corp Enron ENRON Subject Grynberg Quinque Charlie Tetrault called me today to make sure we were aware of one more billing issue arising out of the above referenced cases A little chronology may help Until around October or November of last year V E s bills solely referenced the Grynberg II case Afterwards due to Northern having removed the case V E s bills included a seperate category for Quinque time Starting in January of 2000 however V E s bills the first one being for December time introduced a third category for Joint Defense Work time This third classification represented work done by V E on the proposed Quinque motion to dismiss for lack of standing etc but not for lack of personal jurisdiction which briefing is being done by Fulbright Basically V E Skadden and one other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of standing etc Substantially all that work has already been done according to Charlie The expectation was that e g Enron would pay V E s fees up front Sonat would pay Skadden s bills up front etc then all those who fronted such fees would recover those payments from other members of the joint defense committee who would be billed pro rata What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50 of the Joint Defense Work time category then the Holland Hart trustee who eventually makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity in determining how the reimbursements will be made Charlie really left it up to us as to what we want to do we just need to make sure that everyone including I guess Holland Hart understands that EOG will be one of the ones fronting the money to V E and entitled to receive reimbursement One the other hand I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if Enron paid 100 of the Joint Defense Billing and accordingly got 100 of any reimbursement so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated Frankly I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50 50 split after he sees these most recent bills given that the Jont Defense Billing is exclusively for Quinque work My thought is not to change how we pay the 50 50 split on the bills we have already received but advise V E that for future bills they can bill Enron 100 of the Joint Defense Billing category Please let me know how you

could just get a judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased He offered a flat settlement amount of 15 000 on our claim of 35 284 95 Steve has given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about settling the 11 000 00 claim for the line repairs Quite honestly I don t hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than 15 000 but that is 15 000 more

333rd Judicial District Court of Harris County in connection with a judgment against certain CIGSA entities In the writ the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from the court The writ was issued to enforce an judgment for 1 3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any that might have such funds or assets The lawyer for Mr Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment In the meantime effective immediately do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of or release ANY property to or on behalf of any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval The court may impose penalties for violations of its garnishment order We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on

Ed in other Cogen ma tters before and I have found him to be both effective and efficient Thi s matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000 Da vid Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respe ct to this incident We will need to review NEPCO s contract with Cogen to determine if any such obligations exist The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and to Compel Inspection This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v Co gen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state cou rt as Roger Atkinson v JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection o f the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred I have aske d Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or NEPCO To date we have not However I expect that service of process is in the works and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims I am forwarding a copy to
