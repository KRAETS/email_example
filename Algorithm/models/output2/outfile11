canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet attempting to incorporate the clarifications yeah right that Prof McCullough distributed via email and the stuff we talked about during break i e timing of cash flows The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet And I ve also included the report though I did not peruse it for errors relevancy etc My biggest concern is question 6 My

considerable variability across runs again could be due to screw up on my part so the answers I generatd comes from a run of 5 000 trials If you run the sheet beware 5 000 takes some time unless you
