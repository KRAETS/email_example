with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26 NP15 Buy Resale on a Realtime basis We are not doing a profit split this time we are paying them 25 MW instead This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path This is a sweet strategy when the SP15 NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested NCPA s capacity is 21MW but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it WESCO especially So by doing only 20MW we do not remind them of NCPA The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15 And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour IN CAPS We sell to NCPA in ZP26 We buy from NCPA in NP15 We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26 so enter a EPMI CALPOOL PG E is NCPA s SC so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call NCPA s tel
