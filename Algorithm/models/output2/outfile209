question about what if any price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index deals Here are my thoughts For purposes of this discussion let s just talk about how the Dynegy San Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35 000 MMBtu d for Calendar 2003 c ould impact our fuel risk Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in kind for t his transaction All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi ll have to be provided by TW In a normal year TW over collects approxima tely 25 000 MMBtu d in fuel Because we will now need some of this over co llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal we actually have so mething less than the 25 000 MMBtu d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio n To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion let s assum e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003 we will only have 20 000 MMBtu d of over collected fuel on the system We will need the remaining 5 000 MMBtu d as fuel for the Index to Index deals Let s also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge by means of the whole calendar year seaso nally or monthly the 20 000 MMBtu d of 2003 over collected fuel The rema ining 5 000 MMBtu d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal 20 It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5 000 MMBtu d o f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged On any day where Dynegy would schedule the full 35 000 MMBtu d to flow the fuel actually bu rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in kind fuel on that same day The other shipper s in kind f uel I m referring to the 5 000 MMBtu d that is not hedged is what is actu ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy On this particular day we do not ha ve additional adverse price risk However on any day that Dynegy does not have the full 35 000 MMBtu d scheduled to flow we have an opportunity los s on the value of this fuel If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day there is no fuel burned This means that we now have extra gas that was not previously hedged in the pipe provide d by the other in kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this part icular day Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash p rices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a pri ce that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy thus creating an opportunit y loss 20 Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow Would you agre e that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow 20 Thanks Kim ","message_subject":"Fuel Risk on Index to Index Deals","recipient_count":"2","sender_address":"kimberly.watson@enron.com","recipient_address":"steven.harris@enron.com,
