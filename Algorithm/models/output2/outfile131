further Enron North America Corp From Rebecca W Cantrell 02 01 2001 05 53 PM To Scott Neal HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas Scott this is all I could find about Tennessee s right to buy system gas There was nothing specific to fuel and of course nothing at all about financial transactions I don t read it to prohibit them from buying on a forward basis but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against them too much Basically Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to maintain system integrity And they can buy or sell it either 1 on a first come first served basis at posted prices 2 through an auction or gas trading system or 3 through direct negotiations They no longer have a fuel tracker Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their transportation customers they shouldn t be buying fuel per se The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation so Tennessee would not be required absent a tariff provision to post or report its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them They do however have to file a report of their cashout transactions including any purchases they make for balancing If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing the issue could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC Purchases made for system integrity purposes if not tied to cashout would have to be addressed in the next rate case Fifth Revised Sheet No 209A Schedule LMS MA Load Management Service Market Area continued ii Operational Transactions Operational Transactions are those Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which Transporter may from time to time in its discretion enter into with third parties to balance Transporter s system and to maintain operational integrity Pursuant to this Section 7 g ii Transporter may purchase gas quantities for receipt into its system and may sell gas quantities for delivery out of its system These Operational Transactions may be conducted on a first come first served basis at posted prices or pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading system or negotiated directly with third parties The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout Activity pursuant to Section 7 g i Item No 2 of this Rate Schedule must occur during the Annual Cashout Period provided however that if the quantity of Operational Purchases or Operational Sales as applicable is insufficient to offset the quantity of Net Cashout Activity then an additional month of Operational Transactions ending on September 30 thirteen months after the start of the Annual Cashout Period shall be included in the Cashout Report in order to reconcile Net Cashout Activity Gas quantities from an Operational Transaction which are used to offset Net Cashout Activity in one Cashout Report cannot be used to offset cashout activity in a subsequent Cashout Report iii Annual Cashout Report Transporter shall include in the Cashout Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7 g monthly detail for Item Nos 1 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 g i Such detail

the same I will be back in Houston early next week for the announcement I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the following day I tend to think that the next day may be better In addition as we discussed I would like to get one of the analysts associates working on pulling the following information together List of our states maybe there is some overlap with the mid west but as you know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any confusion Master list of ALL gas users within those states If there are any LDC s etc that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned Delainey continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and nothing falls through the cracks From the master list we can determine our current level of business and relationship with that particular market high medium low From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments This is fundamental but important in my opinion Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff I will not add anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect as we move forward Do you approve of that When is

fifith of sixth time It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900 s A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading Sincerely Scott Neal Chip Ryan cryan lsu edu on 10 19 2000 07 30 58 PM To gdilli2 enron com sneal enron com cc Subject Recruiting Hi Geynille and Scott I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students We appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable contribution One of my former students Milagros Daetz dropped by to see met later in the day to tell me about her Enron interviews Milagros was very excited about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met I want to offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf Milagros is one of the most impressive students I have ever taught While her GPA 3 9 is sufficient to certify her academic record I wanted to comment on her intangible qualities Milagros is mentally tough hard working determined and ambitious Just as important she is a genuinely nice person She deals with people very well and possesses what I would describe as quiet leadership characteristics In other words she leads by example and by reason I also find her to be mature beyond her age and willing to assume responsibility for her own choices In short I think Milagros would be an asset to any organization Again it was good meeting you Please fell free to contact me if I can help you in any way Regards

that no such capability currently exists According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG exploitation of this opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one as far as we know has constructed such a vessel I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the Italian company Tecnomare I contacted them and they indicated that they have not built such a vessel It is estimated that construction of such a vessel would take 2 3 years and as one might imagine achieving the required operational and environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel http www tecnomare it marine project ling htm Please let me know if any further research is needed Charlie

Columbia Gas Transmission Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX Va July 7 PRNewswire Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies Columbia Gas Transmission a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive Internet based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia s current open auction process In a first of its kind filing Columbia proposes a bid offer system for selling capacity similar to on line natural gas commodity trading systems The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC s Order 637 which encourages companies to voluntarily submit new and innovative approaches to capacity auctions Since the filing is not required under Order 637 Columbia s proposed auction is separate from Columbia s Order 637 compliance filing made June 15 Under the current mechanism capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it said Carl Levander vice president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five day period parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid Also since the current process is based on set time periods customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid According to Levander Columbia s proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced Internet based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter term contracts Under Columbia s proposed bid offer system Columbia would offer via its electronic bulletin board sales terms for all its available firm capacity Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding If Columbia offers discounted capacity the customer can counter offer with a different rate Or if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity then a customer can counter offer with a different term length Columbia can match the highest bid subject to a present value process and the sale is immediate and binding At any time before a binding sale the customer can change or withdraw its bid Columbia s bid offer auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERC s Order 637 Columbia s auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at 9 15 a m EST and all available capacity will be posted prior to 8 00 a m EST The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non discriminatory basis The auction is user friendly since it will use Columbia s existing EBB format All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available As is Columbia s current practice winning bids and the bidder s identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids without the bidder s identity will be available for review to all bidders through an Internet based system We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is transparent verifiable and non discriminatory to all parties as well as innovative in design Levander said Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission s principles it is based on feedback gathered from customers who expressed a desire for transparent market information shorter auction periods an ability to withdraw and change bids and a real time immediate closure process Columbia Gas Transmission with offices in Charleston W Va and Fairfax Va moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a 12 550 mile pipeline network which reaches across 10 Midwestern Northeastern and mid Atlantic states The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 billion cubic feet Bcf of working

drop you a line and let you know how I m doing My last semester is shaping up to be pretty tough The MBA class in Real Options is to say the least tough I m preparing for my mid term right now and so far we ve learned about Binomial trees Sharpe ratios the GOPOP model risk neutral pricing Stochastic Processes Black Scholes and Monte Carlo and pricing American European and exotic options What s also great about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example of how this stuff works in the real world It s a great class One of my other classes Economic Forecasting is challenging as well because I m dealing with a software package Eviews for the first time Enough about the academics though I m working hard and that s what I need to be doing I ve also started reading Reminiscences and I find myself highlighting lines on every page I figured I d start with the less technical books first considering my workload I m going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend 3 9 3 11 with my roommate Ed Brady who will also be at Enron in July Let me know how your schedule looks and maybe we can get together Hopefully my getting into your

and let you know how I m doing My last semester is shaping up to be pretty tough The MBA class in Real Options is to say the least tough I m preparing for my mid term right now and so far we ve learned about Binomial trees Sharpe ratios the GOPOP model risk neutral pricing Stochastic Processes Black Scholes and Monte Carlo and pricing American European and exotic options What s also great about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example of how this stuff works in the real world It s a great class One of my other classes Economic Forecasting is challenging as well because I m dealing with a software package Eviews for the first time Enough about the academics though I m working hard and that s what I need to be doing I ve also started reading Reminiscences and I find myself highlighting lines on every page I figured I d start with the less technical books first considering my workload I m going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend 3 9 3 11 with my roommate Ed Brady who will also be at Enron in July Let me know how your schedule looks and maybe we can get together Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading

Neal HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Guaranteeing Index Minus Gas Scott I am talking to DTI CNGT regarding an Index minus sale for April 01 through June 01 of up to 4 Bcf I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option I am not supposed to know about DTI s potential purchase requirements so I changed the quantities and months in the example below since the plan is to take this to her boss Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better Tammi As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee you IF FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle Example Note All prices are notional non transactable numbers DTI requires a total of 610 000 DT in April and May as a 10 000 DT d baseload purchase ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an option Put or Call into the deal for say 5 000 DT d Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915 000 DT in the case of the put or as little as 305 000 DT in the case of a call then ENA can take the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas Let us say ENA is currently offered at IF CNG App Index for April and May Index 2 cents and agrees to sell DTI Index 2 cents ENA has lost 4 cents or 0 04 610 000 24 400 However if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the FOM Index then that would generate 0 10 5 000 61 days 30 500 ENA would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the sale Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas however must have the flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity Remember if the option is out of the money for the entire period DTI will receive only the baseload quantity If ENA exercises the option everyday then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of Index 2 cents This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month period Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee Please let me know if you have any questions If you would like me to do a conference call with Michelle just let me know Thanks Sean ","email_attachment":null,"message_mailbox":"neal-s","received_time":"2001-02-27 02:44:00-08:00","message_subject":"Re:
