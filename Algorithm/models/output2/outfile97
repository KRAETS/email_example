for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions We also use Chase Continental Visa exclusively and my husband is a President s Club member I have made Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past This morning however I had a very bad experience I booked tickets for a vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on December 1 Since I booked the ticket I became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due to complications with my pregnancy My doctor indicated to me that I may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy which is due to end in June I spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on September 5th 2001 and that a 75 service would be charged to me next time I book a ticket for me or my husband I understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn t feel like taking a vacation this weekend In my opinion this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications As you can see with my situation it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy I indicated that I could provide a doctor s note if necessary He was very rude to me stating You don t have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing I already told you NO I had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason but I was hoping that I would be able to fly again by now For your information your competitor was very helpful They accepted my doctor s note gave me a credit good for one year and will allow me to change the ticket to another person s name if I am still unable to use it That ticket was also booked as a non refundable fare Although I have always used Continental for my personal travel the treatment I have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second guess my future choices If there is anything you can do to help I would
