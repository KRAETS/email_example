EnronOnline 1 The online making of a market i e the continuous posting of real time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities 2 The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction 3 The continuous and frequent updating of prices including the operation of the Stack Manager which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person 4 EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language a single line short description of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty 5 The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place 6 It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web based i e the user does not require any system specific software but just a web browser and an internet plug in application 7 The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders 8 Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested 9 The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which

for this Transaction Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc e 20 to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the 20 sentence referring to the quality as well We have changed the first senten ce 20 of the long description to read A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron 20 Broadband Services L P EBS pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an d 20 the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by 20 Counterparty via the Website Does DSO need to be defined somewhere DS0 is a term generally known in t he 20 industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the 20 long description so we chose not to define it also the definition is 20 incredibly long complex and technical If you feel strongly about it we 20 can include it but since the long description tells you how many DS0 s you 20 should include for calculation purposes we didn t think that it was 20 necessary The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me 20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the 20 GTC The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G TC 20 and in the Master Agreement in order to accomodate the way that the price 20 is being quoted on EnronOnline The quote represents the variable component 20 of the Unit Price in the GTC s and the Master Agreement In order not to 20 confuse people we decided to include the formula in both the long 20 description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit 20 Price was calculated using the price quoted Unless industry trading 20 convention is to the contrary the site makes more intuitive sense when the 20 volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units If the volume is 20 Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties or 20 perhaps more likely their lawyers may be confused The GTC contains the 20 defined term Unit Price which is in Bandwidth Unit It seems to me tha t 20 if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth 20 Units we can ignore the number of DSO s per Bandwidth Unit and the number of 20 DSO miles for the transaction 20 Since they won t change from one product to the next the two sentences 20 beginning with Any party entering into a Transaction could be moved to 20 the GTC Since bandwidth is such a new product we really wanted to highlig ht 20 to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth 20 which is what we are offering they will need to establish connectivity wi th 20 us This is already in the GTC but in an abundance of caution we wanted 20 this fact highlighted especially since connectivity will entail further 20 costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation 20 agreements licenses etc this can be quite an involved process The term Contractual Currency is not used int he GTC Can the 20 parenthetical reference come out The EnronOnline people may care about 20 this more than I Agreed If the numbers of miles and DSO s need to stay in the Long Descriptions I 20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO s per Bandwidth 20 Unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and tha t 20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per DSO mile per 20 month It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month 20 Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being 20 offered we felt like the quotation was pretty clear We are also a bit 20 sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo ng 20 description From a commercial perspective we are comfortable that the 20 language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number This needs to be 20 clear from the Long Description If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3 20 Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1 July 31 the Customer 20 would be entitled to 5 OC3 s for the period from July 1 July 31 I hope 20 that this is responsive to your question we weren t entirely

E Commerce Venture FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT Nachamah Jacobovits 212 299 2430 Maria Gonzalez 212 299 2436 NEW YORK NY May 4 2000 The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX an e commerce venture that is intended to become the premier global exchange for over the counter OTC forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical commodity contracts The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter party risk management for OTC trading and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position eNYMEX will provide a single internet based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system depending on the session The Exchange s vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil petroleum products natural gas and electricity with some spot cash market products also offered Over time this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals coal and potentially bandwidth weather and emissions Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations In addition to today s launch announcement the key milestones of eNYMEX are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading followed by Internet based order routing for futures trading including a common interface for OTC and futures trading and clearing and settlement of OTC trading Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open independent and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants price transparency counter party credit risk management and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts Mr Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e commerce with bricks mortar The Exchange s established and well regarded clearinghouse which will be used to provide counter party risk management Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities eNYMEX will be a wholly owned for profit subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange

Grant Oh CAL ECT ECT Subject Choice of Law for Master Firm Gas Purchase Sale Agreement with BC Gas Utility Ltd To The Legal Trading Committee Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada is in the process of negotiating a Master Firm Gas Purchase Sale Agreement the Master with BC Gas Utility Ltd BC Gas In this regard we have recently received a request from BC Gas to amend the applicable law of the Master from Alberta to British Columbia such that subsection 17 12 of the Master would read as follows This Agreement shall be governed by and construed enforced and performed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia without regard to principles of conflicts of law and each Party hereby submits to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia BC Gas has also asked that the applicable law for the guarantee of Enron Corp be governed by the laws of British Columbia While I am fairly sure that we will be able to persuade BC Gas to accept the State of Texas as the appropriate law for the Enron Corp guarantee it seems unlikely because the counterparty is a British Columbia utility that operates primarily in British Columbia that BC Gas will accept any jurisdiction other than British Columbia with respect to the Master Although I have not been called to the bar in British Columbia and there may be some quirks and minor differences between the jurisdictions it is my understanding that the commercial law of British Columbia is generally not much different from that of Alberta Nevertheless I am seeking your comments and consent to such an amendment to the Master Should you have any questions or require additional information please give me a call at 403 974 6708 Thank you for your assistance with this matter Yours truly Mark Powell

definition of Specified Indebtedness which ties into the cross default provisions should be expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional bank borrowings We think there are arguments both ways on this but wonder whether we have a house view Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA schedule we assume that our preferred position is to exclude

Was this agreed by EFR If so OK If not could the CSA provide for other collateral as Gordon requested It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs in non reinsurance situations and would probably cost

is primarily a tax issue However there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific PA provisions for those countries 2 No Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that only the first time they trade that product The GTC s are arranged by Product Type so you only have to agree to it once for that type regardless of how many products there are so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade 3 No But if that would be helpful it can be arranged 4 This one doesn t make much sense to me EnronOnline itself doesn t make any money There is no advertizing and EnronOnline doesn t trade the trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities EnronOnline is actually providing them a service 5 I really have no idea I guess we would have to print out the records and have one of the IT people testify

the following questions that I did not know the answer to Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible 1 They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section 2 of the password application that prohibits the user form using the password outside their country I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but was not sure 2 They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC each time they transact a trade I believe each product is represented by a separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought several related products will probably have identical GTCs I told them I thought that for each product that you only had to select it once but that for each product even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have reviewed you must accept the GTC again Is this correct 3 Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for use of the system 4 They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc for each product could be considered content for EOL and be considered value for which EOL should pay the trading entities I haven t heard of this issue before but I said I would ask 5 As a proof issue what would be the process of proving and electronic trade How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the data How would the data be presented to a

take it with them Apparently they have had some bad experiences with disgruntled traders Thus their proposal that their notice must be by certified mail and the proviso that we have 5 days to act on the notice I have a question regarding the back office suggestion are you suggesting that no individual trader be given an id but rather you give the id to someone in the back office and the trader has to call that individual to actually submit a trade If that s not what you intend even if the back office or control group holds the password if the trader knows the password to get into EOL what s to stop him or her from continuing to access EOL after leaving the company The back office can notify EOL that the password should be cancelled but if we don t act on the notice what is left for the

subsequently left the company Unfortunately access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial here in London on the basis that we are a corporate and not a financial or fund manager Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced time delayed service Investex which is not sufficient for our needs and consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service providing similar or superior functionality Prior to meeting with Thomson I would very grateful if you could enlighten us on any of the following Whether Enron has any relationship and or agreements in place with Thomson Financial in the US If the latter is the case which services we receive from this data supplier If this is not the case which alternative but similar data services we do receive I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here in the UK Alternatively if we do not receive this service in the US it would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative but similar sources of information are available in order that we might have another option should Thomson Financial

normal sailing trip is a week but that s not cast in stone In an effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve pick up the boat on Sunday you get the boat around noon and bring it back the following Sunday by noon take a shower and head straight for the airport Because of the way the flight schedules work it s usually not possible to leave after work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there You could do a shorter trip of course but I never have I ve gone for longer we did a 10 day one way sail from St Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada stopping in Bequia and Mustique among others along the way but that s a pretty long trip and certainly not necessary Most of the charter fleets are based where there is plenty to do right in the area for a week One of the reasons for aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days spent I get both Thurs Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a whole week I understand the gov t may not be so generous I haven t taken all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that works better for you guys My views on when to go January March Very fun since you will be sick of winter very popular so a lot more crowded harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements farther ahead everything is open for business high season rates April May Less crowded unless Easter or Spring breaks are late shoulder season rates June August No crowds you may have some anchorages to yourself many places are closed for the season think beach bars and meals on shore low rates September October See June August and add in highest risk of hurricanes http www storm2000 com My guess is that people who planned their trips to the BVI for this week aren t having much fun right now but they got GREAT deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund I ve chartered during this period several times and had a blast One time a tropical storm came through and we stayed on the boat in port I still get mileage out of the stories You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may not go according to plan not seriously dangerous though you re always within easy reach of the base if a bad one threatens you just take the boat back and let them deal with it November December Hurricane threat drops dramatically Crowds pick up around Christmas everything opens up again rates start to go up again Bottom line I love the trips so much it doesn t matter what time of year just let me know what works best for you guys Keep in mind that you do have to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance more is better to make sure you get flights and the boat that you want One last thought it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to pick someone up This is definitely suboptimal You learn a lot about the boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain or wherever I d rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once but if it s the only way at least it s an option

much inconvenience I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don t have your phone number Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent Part 1 b In our other derivatives trading the cross default test applies to Enron Corp with a Threshold of US 100 000 000 To accomplish this in the schedule Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly Part 1 d Has Baker McKenzie recommended this We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation i e the outstanding transactions terminate automatically leaving us with an open unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it In the U S the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge Part 1 e We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non defaulting party the most flexibility Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature However in many of the markets where we operate quotations will not be available where they are available they may well not be meaningful and the Loss method gives flexibility while still requiring commercial reasonableness Part 1 h ix This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex When we have the ability to ask for or be asked for collateral in the case of a downgrading we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position If the party fails it then becomes a default allowing termination Part 1 h x Wouldn t the cross default be triggered before this could happen Part 2 Have our internal Tax people approved this Part 3 I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to Since Enron Corp will be a Credit Support Provider does it have a Representative Director etc The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary In many non US jurisdictions local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval in others derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents etc Part 5 b g h These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind although they may be helpful for other reasons as well If neither party is in the US the CFTC reason may go away On the other hand since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well If that is our theory there are additional representations the Eligible Swap Participant reps that we should think about putting back in Part 5 d We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions While I think we will get there we haven t actually made the decision yet So far I guess we leave it the way it is Part 5 j My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about Paragraph 13 I have to admit I m not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there s a glitch in the form It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn t be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us The way it is drafted now if either S P or Moody s stops rating us even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur The counterparty doesn t have to worry about Moody s at all Just a thought On the guaranty you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp Legal My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher in this case maybe an extra 5 000 000 than the threshold in the CSA that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded Tana is preparing a red line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don t expect many I hope this is helpful Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things We re looking forward to having you back

would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation within Five Business Days of the Trade Date would be US Dollars 200 000 The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and low Rig Day Rates for JU 300 IC as published by Offshore Data Services Inc or its successor in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig Locator or any successor publication published during the applicable Calculation Period on the page entitled Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and Day Rates The Payment Date s would be the fifth 5th Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile and because we may have made similar proposals to other counterparties is this true this indicative proposal is only good until August 31st 2000 We look forward to further discussions

great place to take beginners I only caught your post of yesterday so didn t see the earlier thread I m assuming you re picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby The only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn t quite ready I ve always used the Moorings so they re the only outfit I know They don t usually let you get started on the boat until after the chart briefing which means you don t go aboard until 10 If you use their provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn t there right on time Having several people but not too many around this time is helpful to put food away take inventory attend boat briefing etc Of course if you get the boat the day before maybe with a sleepaboard option or some such you have that much more certainty that everything will be done on time Check with your charter company about attending the briefings before sending the last person off to the airport some companies may require 2 people from your boat to attend As for first day if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight on Norman Island There are lots of moorings there and you ll get one as long as you re not in too late It shouldn t take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine There are a couple of places a beach bar and a boat to eat and drink there if you don t feel like cooking the first night and although you can t call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there there is at least very little ashore to bother you The caves are just around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling diving either that afternoon or first thing the next day Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn t really matter My advice running roughly clockwise skip Soppers Hole just a commercial port with little of interest unless you re clearing customs skip the USVI all the clearing out in out in can take a lot of time and there s plenty to do in the BVI if you just have to go the northern shore of St John is the best nice anchorages several of the secluded variety without the crime on St Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will let you come ashore for a fancy dinner but make reservations and leave your trash on board there s nowhere to put it Jost van Dyke is fun anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little Harbor Sydney s Peace Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor bar where you mix your own drinks just keep track in his little black book while you re waiting for dinner Foxie s in Great Harbor is a classic beach bar rest lots of fun and good food drinks Sandy Cay is everyone s image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop and a swim don t miss Cane Garden Bay unless the northerly swell is too heavy there s a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and steel drum bands serenade you into the evening watch the reefs but the channel in is well marked if there s a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night Cane Garden works fine to get to Bomba s Shack for the party there are lots of taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back it s easy to pick people up or drop them off at the airport close to the water with a dinghy dock midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met that way the Baths are a must but VERY crowded no anchoring allowed must use a mooring so I d try to get there as early in the day as possible Cooper Island Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before maybe get up early motor or sail over and have breakfast once you re safely moored and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones reserved for commercial craft I usually skip Spanish Town Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor since I d rather be at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze but if you stay there you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is not serious enough about fresh water conservation and what crew ever is the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower I think you pay at the resort front desk and maybe a fancy dinner and there is also a water dock there 10 cents a gal Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don t get to sail enough you shouldn t have any trouble getting a lot in but you won t be able to see everything The only difficulty might be if you need to get the boat back in for an early flight but I ve let people out at Cane Garden Bay to take a taxi to the early flight then sailed around to have the boat back well before noon Having said that I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for your last night it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely And just as I mentioned for the first night it makes sense to get into most anchorages early rather than late so you re sure to get a mooring in those that have them and don t have to worry about finding a spot for the boat many of them can get quite crowded Of course if you re going anytime between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn t be any trouble with crowds just pay daily close attention to the weather forecasts Don t expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at nearly every anchorage many are closed in the low season A few of the islands have some good hiking but there s not much for the sight seers either But snorkeling and diving are everywhere Ask at your chart briefing for the best spots these days If you have divers along don t miss the wreck of the Rhone you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and bring along equipment and a guide for the divers The cruising guide will have lots of info on all these issues Wish I was going it s always a blast

If we include Amanda I think it is either Nov 3 8 or it is Thanksgiving We could do a long weekend on either of those dates or if you want to take the whole week off you and I could go for the week

com 09 05 00 09 22PM Wow too many choices Let s see the day of the week charters start and end is not fixed except that the boat has to be available on the days you want it We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down It s much harder to get there from Houston than NYC fewer flights so it pretty much takes all day to get there The 3rd 8th is a Friday through Wed not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose it just means a 4 day instead of 7 day charter If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the 2 of us particularly if we got one of the smaller boats and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won t be all that challenging I hear the St Martin area can get rougher Plan B sounds like fun too and then we could all go together later it seems mean to go without Bill New Years sounds like a blast to me What would you think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before 12 29 or 30 and spending the first week of January there That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn t have to be back in school til later I have a couple of

and end is it set in stone Plan B we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001 Of course that does make New Year s eve a

going to talk tomorrow 20 and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we 20 have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a 20 master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many 20 of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have 20 trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be 20 helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a 20 mark up Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part 1 a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the 20 possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for 20 example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy 20 this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk 20 to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a 20 reason to remove it Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells 20 out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e 20 not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we 20 agree we will put it in the agreement Part 4 f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t 20 payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t 20 i e if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to 20 make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne 20 payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part 5 a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to 20 receive payments due even though technically in default under another 20 provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other 20 possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be 20 honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same 20 city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot 20 impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city 20 e The change to 10 business days is much too long This means we can no t 20 have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go 20 as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market 20 practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o 20 multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set off with each 20 IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never 20 trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we 20 will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually don t like 20 to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If 20 there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t 20 wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part 1 g this section adds flexibility to both parties while 20 maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency 20 with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is 20 important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t 20 went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money 20 We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur 20 revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r 20 high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the non default rate i s 20 more appropriate m I can t imagine why they wouldn t want this section included it 20 protects us both n You know more about this than I Part 6 These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them 20 individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns 20 are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a 20 significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it 20 and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I 20 hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long I m happy to discus s 20 any of these issues at greater length

hoping you can shed some light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to customers electronically One solution that we could implement in the future is to send the file to the customer in pdf format however the customer will need the applicable software to launch the program we could include a link to download this The immediate solution is to discontinue this practice

Neuner HOU ECT ECT Justin Timothy ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT ECT Mark Taylor HOU ECT ECT Justin Boyd LON ECT ECT Jonathan Marsh EU Enron Enron ECT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator SFC has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap or any other product listed on EOL would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong Again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a 27 September 2000 advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy HK In Section 2 they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance Way Forward I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen at least for the present The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised This possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list HK weather products Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts SFC interest Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an SFC instigated dialogue on this point This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first I note Allen Overy also raised this as a possibility I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present Amita Gosalia ECT 13 11 2000 07 04

in record numbers to vote in near universal opposition to the self declared winner s candidacy 6 Imagine that hundreds of members of that most despised caste were intercepted on their way to the polls by state police operating under the authority of the self declared winner s brother 7 Imagine that six million people voted in the disputed province and that the self declared winner s lead was only

The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in so we have to review those documents before trading That is more than we do for run of the mill domestic corporates and takes a lot of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty About a year ago a major hedge fund Long Term Capital got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in orchestrating a bail out There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds none of them good Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don t want that spotlight shining on us In case you re interested notwithstanding their name hedge funds are speculators Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging as opposed to speculation was safer and therefore more palatable The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets Hence the regulators heightened scrutiny For both of these reasons when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds or individuals for similar reasons Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their

acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick O Brian to my attention claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the English language Being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including of course all of Forster s Hornblower books I had my doubts But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen O Brian Aubrey Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe I wholeheartedly concurred After a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful life enriching experience he had given me Since O Brian obviously loved the sea it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight s cruse aboard my Perini ketch the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O Brian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was I get about 20 000 letters per year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting So I wrote via his publisher having literally no idea where in the world he lived and after some forwarding delay I received his handwritten reply in his fine and precise penmanship saying I accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste As Mr O Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995 that included San Francisco I invited him to dinner the week of his visit and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall His host was the poet laureate of America Robert Haas I was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to O Brian s lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner The following evening he and his wife Mary came to my house in Belvedere for a literary dinner with admirers and one or two other authors Mr O Brian was utterly charming if perhaps a little aloof He took tremendous interest in an Admiralty Board dockyard model I have of an English First Rater of 1702 He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge After the other guests departed we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and I discovered 1 his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own 2 his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown American me and 3 his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed amazingly almost nil After a half liter of cognac had vanished and we were still calling each other Mr O Brian and Mr Perkins I produced a chart of the Mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise I had learned that the O Brians home was in Collioure a village on the Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border in Basque country The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby where Andromeda could pick all of them up O Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily a stop in Greece dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the Balearic islands I was stunned How I wondered could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over 3 000 nautical miles with numerous port calls in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in Naples Capri and Tangiers as well While I could not reconcile this plan with reality I assumed it was the wine in control and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening s end that he had a major non negotiable condition to accepting my offer namely that I personally would join him Mary and their guests aboard my yacht In May 1995 as the departure date appoached I had a rough time getting Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions I have been pasted and this was one of the worst Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well but after a real dusting we made it and O Brian and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar I was fascinated by his office where the books were written It was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects botany geography zoology medicine etc in several languages but not a single volume dated later than 1820 He was literally immersed in the period of his work The following morning we were joined by his close friend the scholar and foremost authority on Peeps Richard Ollard his publisher Stuart Proffit and his agent Vivien Green We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the Balearic islands and O Brian somewhat wistfully asked if an additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible Told it was not he boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver short changing him on his yachting holiday Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind the sailing was marvelous and O Brian was delighted I introduced him to the helm but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day However he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness Mary quiet kind interesting and interested was wonderful to have aboard However she was very frail They were both nearly 80 and I constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship s motion but thankfully this never occurred Before dinner O Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally I found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had ever experienced and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I was left far behind My MIT engineer s degree had alas not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level It was literally exhausting but a marvel to follow The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca O Brian suggested that we sail sail not motor into the long narrow channel leading to the port of Mahon the location of the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda s size but I carried it off happily without mishap We had an interesting afternoon ashore with O Brian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan the local tongue That evening while at dinner back aboard the yacht he suggested for the first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me And so our cruise continued with Patrick showing keen interest in everything we fished with some success we sailed every day we visited the port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character Stephen Maturin who is clearly modeled on Patrick s physique and personality One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal It started with Patrick asking me if I had heard of a place Indiana and a school the University of Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible The University s English department had purchased and not yet paid for two or three of Patrick s manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O Brian which Patrick found intensely offensive Patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels Richard Ollard was aghast and Ms Green was very upset with this quite startling revelation Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso s letters when he had written a well received biography of the artist Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him but that he Patrick could not rely upon the goodwill of some post doctoral American fool So the tension filled discussion continued The analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist s frame of mind at the time of creation Now after Patrick s death we understand some of his thinking He was his own construct born Patrick Russ English not Irish not university educated not a sailor a father who abandoned his family and altogether a piece of his own fiction But that night aboard Andromeda only Mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine Mediterranean weather While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in light wind with our centerboard keel raised and guided by as it turned out an inaccurate Spanish chart we decided to sail between the coast and a small island and we ran firmly aground in shallow water In the Med one can t simply wait for a higher tide so we emptied all our fresh water tanks and tried to back off No luck I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air over ten tons Still no luck Finally we tied a long hawser to a rock astern and using our anchor windlass to bar tight tension we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations He nearly believed I thought that we had arranged the event for his entertainment One morning at breakfast after our friendship had become more firmly established Patrick said Tom I wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world What is software My answer The piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software satisfied him and upon reflection myself as well Every afternoon between two and five Patrick retired to my on board office to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral then in progress He borrowed the yacht s charts of France particularly the area around Brest to incorporate detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book Very much to Mary s surprise he showed me each day s progress She said that he had never shared his work with anyone before completion Later Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business required that all of Patrick s guests and I depart He and Mary continued on to Ibiza with the yacht s crew for three further days mostly to study that island s renowned bird colonies Then they sailed uneventfully back to Port Vendres My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year We corresponded He and Mary stayed in my home They were aboard my schooner Mariette We met at his club Brooks in London He was a genius and his books remain a towering towering achievement I miss him greatly tom perkins

Mark Taylor on 04 16 2001 03 30 PM To Bill D Hare HOU ECT ect cc Samuel Schott HOU ECT ECT Tana Jones HOU ECT ECT Stephanie Sever HOU ECT ECT Subject Urgent Counterparty Divisions Cargill Ferrous International Bill If Sam s description below of the GCP procedure is correct it looks to me like something needs to be changed The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty s name from Global Counterparty Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself That is the source of Tana s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure please let me know Mark ","message_id":"<7976060.1075860325089.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","received_time":"2001-04-16

of the easiest places in the world to sail around for a few days Navigation is easy you can always see where you re going the waters are protected no big waves and the wind consistent and not too strong so the boat will move but not be hard to handle The skills you mentioned sitting drinking socializing are in fact the critical skills for a trip like this We sure don t want anyone on board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas If you want a sneak preview try The Moorings website www moorings com Under Destinations we re going to the British Virgin Islands Under Charter

you need to leave a contact number with someone give them the Moorings number in Tortola 284 494 2332 They ll try and reach us either by phone or radio if a call comes in 2 A lot of places will take

recent edition of the cruising guide to the Virgin Islands It s not required reading but I thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we haven t been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation restaurants bars etc you will see little hand drawn charts of the most popular anchorages these are surprisingly useful There s a lot of information in there If you want to focus on just a few the places we are in my humble and easily overridden opinion most likely to visit are Road Town that s where we will pick up the boat so we re pretty certain to be there The Bight on Norman Island deserted island but a floating bar restaurant good snorkeling nearby Jost Van Dyke we have always liked Sydney s Peace Love in Little Harbor and Foxy s in Great Harbor Sandy Cay the classic deserted island very small probably just a lunch or quick swim stop Cane Garden Bay a little tricky getting in but well worth it the quintessential Caribbean beach swath of white sand palm trees steel bands etc Trellis Bay closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called The Last Resort Cooper Island nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining option The Baths wouldn t be a trip to the BVI without a stop here Bitter End Yacht Club probably about as far as we d want to go There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St John but it is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and customs in the BVI then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St John and then back into the BVI when we go back over there Kind of a lot of trouble particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it s impossible to find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in We ve done it before but my view is that with limited time it just isn t worth it Of course we started this with the assumption that my view isn t necessarily controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at Caneel Bay fancy resort on St John So stay tuned We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola which probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St John the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport One alternative is to stay at Trellis Bay or right across at Marina Cay that night and just dinghy you over to the dock it s a 5 min walk to the airport Or we can drop you anywhere else there s a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just isn t that big I don t think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide They aren t that important unless you check bags Please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day I m not sure but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing

INDEXES TOP STORIES NEWS SPORTS BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT Filed at 3 21 p m EST By The Associated Press LONDON AP Patrick O Brian whose celebrated novels of 19th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers has died He was 85 O Brian died in Dublin Ireland where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College The cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date The British Embassy in Paris said O Brian died Tuesday but newspapers and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday O Brian had lived in France since 1949 O Brian s major work was a 20 volume series set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs his readers were gripped by the slow motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail The series begun in 1969 with Master and Commander is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer Jack Aubrey and the ship s surgeon Stephen Maturin a naturalist and secret agent who doesn t much like sailing Although the books were well reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start it wasn t until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the historical fiction genre in which they generally were reviewed In 1991 a New York Times critic called O Brian the best novelist you have never heard of Patrick O Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997 praising the intensity of characterization the complex elegance of the plotting and the brilliance of the writing O Brian also proved that in the hands of a skilled writer specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding Readers who can t remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind and the excitement as a man of war turns to engage the enemy A lexicon explaining O Brian s nautical terminology was published but O Brian didn t think definitions important Ignorance of the cross catharpins is not necessarily fatal he once said Explanation almost certainly would be O Brian s fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley a former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O Brian s originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of history to invent a new style of fiction No other writer Bayley wrote not even Melville has described the whale and the wandering albatross with O Brian s studious and yet lyrical accuracy O Brian guarded his privacy and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life He was born Dec 12 1914 in Chalfont St Peter west of London and it wasn t until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed the Daily Telegraph said in an obituary Friday The newspaper said O Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ but changed his name in 1945 During his school years he was frequently ill spending much time reading His writing career began at age 15 when he published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard During World War II O Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with Britain s Political Intelligence Department In 1949 he and his second wife Mary moved to Collioure southern France His first seafaring novel was The Golden Ocean in 1956 about a Pacific expedition O Brian s Aubrey Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the beginning of the 1990s when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher W W Norton chanced to read one on a flight home The rest as they say is publishing history Several years ago the writer said he would end the series with the 20th book but last month he said he was working on volume 21 the Daily Telegraph reported O Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks A linguist he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and Colette O Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995 Funeral plans were not announced He is survived by a son Richard from his first marriage

of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict the ETA should control In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty s lawyer paragraph by paragraph to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3 e regarding confirmations this may be different in the UK version the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6 e And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website perhaps Paragraph 3 a can read

America Corp FROM 09Kenneth M Raisler 20 09David J Gilberg RE 09Enron Online Credit Product This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our 20 meeting on January 13 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ es 20 product the 01 Product 018 to be offered by Enron Capital Trade Resour ces 20 International Corp and its affiliates collectively 01 Enron 018 throug h 01 Enron 20 Online 018 These procedures which we will be assisting you in preparing are 20 designed to reduce Enron 01 s exposure to those entities on whose credit th e 20 Product will be based the 01 Reference Entities 018 as well as Enron 01 s exposure 20 to other related types of liabilities We have previously outlined these 20 areas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15 1999 and December 22 20 1999 20 1 Disclosure 01 All Reference Entities should be advised by letter of the 20 fact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the 20 subject of the Product These disclosures will of course be separate from 20 although related to the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to 20 transactions in the Product This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of 20 the Product and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner in 20 which it will be traded e g through Enron Online In general however Enron need not request that the Reference Entities 20 consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference 20 Entities except as set forth below in paragraph 2 20 2 Consent 01 Enron should however obtain the prior consent of certai n 20 types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference 20 Entities In particular consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit h 20 which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or 20 other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t he 20 Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha t 20 could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme nt Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated 20 counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron 20 trades on an exclusively arms 01 length basis with no advisory or similar 20 services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations Where consent is sought Enron should include a request that the Referenc e 20 Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being 20 included in the list of Reference Entities If a Reference Entity fails or 20 refuses to execute the letter Enron will need to make a determination on a 20 case by case basis as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o n 20 the list of Reference Entities However it should be recognized that by 20 requesting consent Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as a 20 Reference Entity in the absence of consent 3 Chinese Wall 01 We understand that it will not be feasible to construc t a 20 complete 01 Chinese Wall 018 between the operations related to the Product and 20 Enron 01 s other trading activities This is due primarily to the fact tha t 20 activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as 20 Enron 01 s other trading activities However Enron should implement a mod ified 20 Chinese Wall between the trading operations This approach would enhance 20 Enron 01 s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety or 20 breach of duty by facilitating Enron 01 s ability to demonstrate that 20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the 20 Product This could be accomplished through a number of procedures First Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical 20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc t 20 on the one hand and Enron 01 s other trading activities on the other hand 20 Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as 20 other traders it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the 20 floor set off by partitions or similar features Second procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio n 20 between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t o 20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public 20 domain In addition all trading personnel should be instructed with respe ct 20 to the procedures through training programs Finally senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit or 20 communications between the groups of traders and to review and make 20 determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would 20 otherwise be prohibited under the procedures These procedures will be 20 similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron 01 s equ ity 20 trading activities 4 Restricted List Enron should establish and maintain a 01 restricted list 018 20 of those entities on which Products may not be traded Initially the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i s 20 not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its 20 relationships with such entities e g those entities with respect to whic h 20 Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their 20 inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives 20 material non public information In addition those entities with which 20 Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to be 20 excluded depending on the terms of such agreements Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of 20 information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed 20 Pursuant to these procedures Enron should suspend the listing of quotation s 20 and therefore the issuance of new Products with respect to a Reference 20 Entity if Enron is in possession of material non public information 20 regarding such Entity of a type or in situations that render suspension 20 necessary or advisable This would include situations in which Enron is 20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity I n 20 addition the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud ed 20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron 01 s possession of information as 20 well e g where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with 20 respect to such Entities 20 The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for a 20 Product held by a counterparty if the counterparty specifically requests 20 Enron to do so The procedures should also address the pricing of the 20 closing transaction however and establish a mechanism for such pricing th at 20 minimizes Enron 01 s potential exposure to liability as a result of its 20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material non public 20 information 20 Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel which should 20 include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi th 20 any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the 20 restricted list 20 As noted we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew which wi ll 20 need to be integrated into Enron 01 s existing policies and procedures In 20 addition as we have advised you in our prior memoranda there are no 20 procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities 20 arising in connection with its offering of the Product However the 20 implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr on 20 in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by 20 Reference Entities Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues 20 K M R 20 D J G

to me after our meeting in Louise s office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed As we discussed last week without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible Bryan Seyfried 01 19 2000 06 35 AM To Mark Taylor HOU

to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them As an initial step I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties Hopefully I am restating what everyone

Release SOURCE Enron Corp Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference Provides Business Overview and Goals for 2000 HOUSTON Jan 20 PRNewswire Enron Corp NYSE ENE news hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in Houston Ken Lay Enron chairman and chief executive officer opened the conference by highlighting Enron s tremendous growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade Enron presented key objectives for 2000 Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses Break out performance from Retail Energy Services Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services Enron s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day Wholesale Energy Business Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services Enron s largest business Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition Finally Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March 2000 EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative Internet based transaction system Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10 000 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November 1999 Yesterday EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with over 700 transactions representing a notional value of 250 million Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods Enron s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing with expansions planned or underway on several of its systems Retail Energy Services With over 16 500 facilities under management the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide As the strong contracting momentum continues Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000 Enron Energy Services goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing 16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energy services nearly double the level in 1999 Enron Broadband Services The new name of Enron s communications business Enron Broadband Services reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband services Enron is deploying an open flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point to point fiber network This Enron Intelligent Network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers thus providing the platform for two new Enron business centers bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery A direct transfer of Enron s core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible low cost capacity Enron will also provide premium broadband content services such as high quality video streaming and large broadband file transfer with differentiated levels of quality in a usage based business model As announced in a separate release Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Internet services Enron is one of the world s leading electricity natural gas and communications companies The company which owns approximately 34 billion in energy and communications assets produces electricity and natural gas develops constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business Enron s

1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries the ability to penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas electricity and broadband services markets including the energy outsource market in the United States and Europe the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil natural gas electricity and those relating to broadband services and content the timing and effect of changes in interest rates the timing and success of Enron s efforts to develop domestic

lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship would that be acceptable to everyone Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities Of

may submit their offers to transact either to buy or sell with Enron The page will list a reserve price and identify the number of credits to be auctioned We are willing to commit to transact up to that number with the best bidders at or beyond the reserve price but may transact larger volumes if we choose Users offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period this time frame remains a bit unclear probably one day possibly a week or more and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders Certain uncreditworthy users may be required

paragraph 1 the usual practice in North America would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters I m not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6 Is this particular to credit derivatives With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9 we need to be aware that these GTC s can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User It is not entirely clear that all sub users will have the authority to amend the ETA Is the purpose of the second sentence to deactivate master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction If so in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties I can t remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control I m sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed 90 days might do it I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days I m uncomfortable with the use of the term Month What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30 You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives should we apply a different interest rate to non US payments It is Mark Haedicke s relatively unwavering policy that US derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason Again

the indemnity clause under Australian law The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US The suggested amendment to clause 3 c I believe we could dispense with It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server However from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality GTCs Minor changes The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the collateral clause Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the

still up even if it went down that much today It s up 40 since the beginning of the year when the Dow was down As recently as mid December the stock price is up about 75 That s one reason why it s so volatile Some people bought in along the way they ve had a good strong increase particularly with the uncertainty in the marketplace people just want to take some money off the table As we become more of a technology stock a high P E stock a growth stock held by growth portfolios you re going to have more volatility just like all the other companies that fit into that category Throughout the market technology stocks quite often go up or down not just 3 4 a whack but often 10 12 15 a whack What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the upside but I hate it on the down side We ve had a change in the ownership of our stock Increasingly it s being bought by the growth portfolio managers and increasingly it s being sold by the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower valuations and now at these values they want to take their money and put it back into lower P E stocks I know this makes everybody a little nervous but this is probably the world we re in

world of business there s a growing trend at some companies Workers are bringing their pets to the office Chip Paucek who produces educational videos and television programs has been taking his golden retriever Hoss to work for the last five years Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co Anchor Jane Clayson The dog has became the office mascot says Paucek He brings a lot of emotion and people love it He s very relaxed But Paucek as co president of his company has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes Not everybody can bring their pet to work A lot of it depends on the dog says Paucek who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog He just hangs out explains Paucek He s easy to get along with Hoss has free rein at the office When Paucek is away on trips My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office Paucek says While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace there are also many legal issues to consider John Challenger CEO of an international placement company agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace says Challenger He points out however that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets in the office policy One of the things that the companies must do before they jump into a policy like that is take a poll of their employees and find out what they re thinking If you have certain employees that don t feel comfortable with pets you might want to rethink the policy There are liability questions as well For example the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect says Challenger The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone it can t be the company s fault Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office Many people are allergic to cat hair You have to think as an employer will you put them in a certain part of your space What about people who are afraid of animals Many don t feel comfortable with them around Just how many do you want Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds What about the noise of birds Paucek admits that when there s more than one pet in the office It gets chaotic In 1997 the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1 225 pet owners They found that 21 of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 76 feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they re on the job 33 said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals If a company decides to allow pets in the office they should poll employees before they let the pets come provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office establish an off limits to pets area make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated bar noisy destructive or messy animals from the office tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times If many employees want to bring their pets to the office the company should make a rotating schedule When the pets in the office policy does work it s great Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work I get off the elevator He goes one way and I go the other He says hello to the employees He has his own web page ","message_id":"<19905263.1075860070118.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","received_time":"2000-03-21

essential As is the case for all EnronOnline trading the online GTC s governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product e g English law for UK gas New York law for US

Form for data References to Distributor s Subsidiaries have been added in the license grant in Section 4 1 of the T C as well as in the indemnification section in Section 14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor s Subsidiaries Because of the wider scope of the license a Section 16 10 has been added to make clear that if any of Distributor s Subdiairies breach the Agreement Reuters will look to Enron Corp rather than the individual subsidiary The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that Enron s subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs Reuters does not want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant subsidiary to remedy the breach Mark I hope the added language addresses your concern

Washington House was over twenty years ago now I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law school in Michigan My first job after graduating was for a law firm in Houston They opened a New York office in the mid 80 s and I went there to help out The office wasn t successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total One of those years was spent working in Asia primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong I ve now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron a large energy company and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically I m actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I m helping them get some products ready to trade online I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town I think I was there the 11th 12th I ve stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M C from time to time Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back unfortunately I haven t really stayed in touch very well There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven t been back for a while of course Woodbine is gone there s a new theater a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations And I understand there are big plans for more they are going to close Sixth Street tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm a big expansion to the sports facilities indoor track pool etc and a redesign of the library Enrollment is up above 1000 Congratulations on your successful career who would have thought when we got out of school so many

Enron EnronXGate Sub ject Margin Calls Financial 09 Mark I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit s requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities i e use of defined terms currency specification notice and delivery timin g notice addresses etc It seemed to me that the form they are using m ay have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is no t a drafting exercise on a case by case basis Practically to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery there really is no subst antive concern However as credit is becoming a significant issue in comm odity markets if the counterparty wants to object particularly in circums tances where their credit is getting tight I can see the lack of contrac tual compliance perhaps being problematic Can somebody in your group deve lop a template perhaps a few will be required that could be

energy and communications co nglomerate Enron s Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electro nics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entert ain on demand EOD service Under the terms of the March 19 deal Electro nics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld com will stream leading games for rental t o Enron s broadband customers The deal is a positive development for Enro n after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster which the companies announ ced March 9 that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video on demand service The exclusive relationship has not yield ed the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this excit ing new on demand service explains Kenneth D Rice president and CEO of Enron Broadband Services The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtua lly complete notes James Yannello a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warb urg I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of it ems to end users I would guess they need to do some more deals driving tr affic on to their systems I think they can bounce back pretty quickly fr om the Blockbuster deal I think the blow was more psychological and I woul d suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggre ssive price targets on the company which is what they did The failure o f the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20 year agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery business I don t see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron Bob Christensen a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp tell s Broadband Networking News I think they will probably get one or two a nchor tenants before the year is out I am optimistic The deal with Elec tronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived f rom its bandwidth intermediation business which uses pooling points to pro vide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers a llowing users to provide bandwidth on demand This is Enron s core telecom business The content deals while important are not being factored into most analysts forecasts on the company I am confident that the conten t delivery business will be successful says Ray Niles a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney The fact of the matter is they did get a nother deal It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal but they did get another one in there We are not putting numbers in our model and our earni ngs forecast for content delivery Whether it is very successful or not ver y successful in our forecasts we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business I think bandwidth intermediation is the ir competitive advantage The reality is that no one had any earnings f rom Blockbuster in the company projections for several years at best Yan nello adds It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app It i s disappointing but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in Enron whi ch produced revenues of over 101 billion in 2000 from its various business es is still rated highly by analysts despite the failure of the Blockbust er deal We have a 100 target price and a strong buy rating Yannell o says That assumes roughly 75 of value for their energy business and 2 5 of value for their broadband services division I think given what has ha ppened in the broader market in the telecom arena and given that the Block buster deal has falling apart I think we be will

always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed If that is not the case I don t object to doing away with them altogether We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis We haven t actually gotten there with anyone yet having just started the actual discussions this week Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate Initially we are only working on physical power physical natural gas and derivatives transactions other than weather The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered This will obviously be a very time consuming and laborious process The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis If any Canadian deals are at issue we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations Hope this is helpful Let me know if it makes sense to you Mark P S Please be careful when
