Follow up Steve Following up on our conversation Friday we have advised Cliff Baxter s Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through Security on the Plaza without showing his access card or requiring his quests to sign in or identify themselves All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through without delay by lifting the adjacent rope We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers as per standard procedure when he is entering the building by himself We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems data base the Reception Desk to make it easier on a visitor of any employee For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry that guest can get a badge without signing in Again we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a visitor pass We are working on installing a new data base the Desk that will pull up a digitised photo of the employee duplicate of what s on their badge on the screen This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without showing other ID and will speed process Finally we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be a duplicate back up

Hardy ENRON DEVELOPMENT on 05 10 2001 09 48 AM To Rebecca McDonald Enron EnronXGate cc Ben Glisan ECT Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron Rob Walls ENRON enronXgate Subject USG overtures on Dabhol Rebecca At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya another of our problem projects Dabhol was raised A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project In Trakya for example the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project I wanted you to be aware of this also any guidance you can provide would be helpful Thanks John

participate in open seasons for capacity gas utilities fialed to fill storage gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its

AM To Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron cc Subject House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California Western Electric Situation Steve I ve been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it s a red flag My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity i e marketers and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points Whoever is blamed might not really matter My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West This of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets Commissioner Massey Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity which by the way doesn t appear to address storage Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport costs Ray

to 75 100 people The ages experiences and business affiliation of the members will be very diverse but all will have the common thread of business excellence The details of this event are still being

schuler rice edu on 05 01 2001 10 59 10 AM To skean enron com cc Subject my work situation Dear Steve Jim and Rick I just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at Rice and to inquire as to a future project with your group at Enron First I apologize for my prolonged recent absences I have had two long standing academic projects one was due 4 19 it was on final review a paper about corporate political strategy and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal and another is due 5 31 The 5 31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function In order to get it done properly I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month A project of interest to me at Enron and I hope one that you also have interest is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings especially in a system where for example on the legislative side much of the work of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages I suspect that govt affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify I d like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary At some point let me know how you would like to proceed Otherwise I hope all is well with you all Cordially Doug Doug Schuler Rice

Subject Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business Wednesday We hope to have agreed on the Q A s by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday John To be sent to All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom Coal LNG Weather We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities However while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron s traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market deleted text Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron The Equity FX Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business These employees remain in Enron Credit a part of Enron Europe EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London The IT HR Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London Nick O Day who heads the Public Affairs group Government Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston We anticipate that his team s efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS Industrial Markets We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company

Enron ENRON cc Mary Schoen NA Enron Enron Stacey Bolton NA Enron Enron Lisa Jacobson ENRON enronXgate Linda Robertson NA Enron ENRON Subject DRAFT response to Greenpeace Kyoto letter Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace s April 5 letter to Jeff Skilling asking for Enron s answers to some specific questions on the Kyoto Protocol and climate change Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron s offices in the UK Netherlands Spain and Belgium I have attached a copy of one of the letters below All the questions are the same in each I have drafted a response with the goals of 1 Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without greenwashing We have an already published public statement on climate change and a very positive solution oriented story to tell with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider positive responses and not in the stack of non responses or we don t care responses 2 Steering away from directly answering the no win questions about Kyoto I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter I have discussed this with many of you already but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like dislike support oppose about Kyoto we ll quickly get into questions we can t now answer and may never be able to answer I d prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue 3 Developing corporate wide messages that we can use in multiple applications arming our PR and govt affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q A Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report Sorry for the long preamble but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late and our message strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use With that said I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers and really stick to the boundaries of what s in our response letter There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas I am not opposed to doing so but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go Please let me know if you have other views I would like to send our response by early next week maybe even Monday 4 23 if we can turn it around that fast Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply Jeff Jeffrey Keeler Director Environmental Strategies Enron Washington DC

position on Kyoto All I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from Greenpeace if at all The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e mail and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it was delivered I think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to Greenpeace based on the statements we ve already documented and the strategies we are developing Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can use in multiple areas ASAP upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report Enron Business articles and other internal uses responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q A and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work The Greenpeace questions are tricky and set up no win answers for the most part I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol In my opinion we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope its best to stick with the solution oriented approach we ve always taken For this reason I was a bit concerned to see in the e mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer s statement on Kyoto given to Jackie Gentile in London Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives etc Also this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don t think we have answers to like What about Kyoto is not workable What would make it workable and would we help make it workable If not Kyoto what is Enron s preferred vehicle I d really rather stay with a constructive solution oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this but I think we need to decide on a global corporate wide response to Greenpeace I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject or just field comments by e mail whatever works best Thoughts Jeffrey Keeler Director Environmental Strategies Enron Washington DC office 202 466 9157 Cell Phone

Subject Re ISO Market Stabilization Plan Tim although there s always a chance my impression is that the FERC won t buy the ban on exports as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish with their own Order 888 and 2000 initiatives I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term If they try to do so without FERC approval possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC asking for fast track processing this fast is measured in weeks not days and or seeking injunctive relief in court faster which can be hard to obtain but not impossible depending entirely on the circumstances Will keep you posted if I learn anything new

communications are always complete firm clear and polite I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts security has been so confused by our end I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway I have asked John to lead the effort to the extent you need him John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office Mike Hicks is a good hand but for the most part all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron s corporate security needs A little background I ll bore you with after Andre Legallo formerly VP of Security for Enron left we did not replace his function Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups When Andre left we reduced the corporate function to a default provider role if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting Mike Hicks as well as an outside consulting firm would help identify competent resources in the area With the reorganization of EBS I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled led by John Brindle John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca he did It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks who I have asked to return to Houston The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying we re from corporate and we re here to help If you don t need any help or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better let me know To Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron cc Rebecca McDonald Enron EnronXGate James A Hughes Enron EnronXGate Subject India Help Steve As you are well aware we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India We are using several parts of your team and are very pleased with most I want to mention a couple of areas HR and Security 1 HR I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger helping our team led by Sandip Malik and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip Bob got on a plane immediately and came over and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back We really relied heavily on HR and Drew had his team there for us 2 PR top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston Great efforts and productive work 3 Security This area has not worked as well and if you ever want feedback on our one time experience with this group I will provide it I don t have any idea who is in charge from Enron s perspective here There are 2 groups headed this way Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike and Don Hawkins sent me an e mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security John Brindle has sent me an e mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night First we are very happy to have the help but I just hope that Mike Jim and John know which of the three are in charge If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge we will coordinate with that person On a side note the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler both of whom work for John Sherriff They had a great attitude were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come At Mike s earlier suggestion we engaged Hill Associates to help on security Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill Associates removing in a lowkey yet rush manner over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers desktops and laptops In addition she has coordinated security for all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony Duenner of EBS Asia Again we appreciate all the help Wade

a summary of items to discuss with Glynn Adding Enron s negative CTC claim to the list of claims PGE s filing included a list of top twenty creditors Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list The list is nonbinding however PG E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20 Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F for unsecured claims You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear preferably as uncontested in the April 20 filing Note if PG E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim Including Enron on the Creditors Committee PG E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors committees There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included 1 we are a big creditor 2 we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3 we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers and PG E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"kenneth.lay@enron.com","sent_time":"2001-04-09

School of Business and the Energy Resources Group at UC Berkeley The syllabus for the course is attached We have 43 graduate students in the course most pursuing a masters degree in business or energy resources though there are also a few PhD students These are very smart students many of whom already have experience in the energy industries and we believe the course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any energy related organization that they would join Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent employment starting as early as May If Enron has openings that you would like to advertise to these students please send me the job description or the URL for it and I can forward it to the class list Jim and I think this is a very strong class and

your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op ed and redistribute it to as yet undetermined people along with various Enron material They also wanted to post it on Enron s public web site But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op ed on your intranet for educational use only for your internal folks If this is correct we would have no problem with it In fact we have posted the op ed on the CERA web page which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic If I misunderstood you and you do want to redistribute the piece to third parties that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and branding issues Obviously we would need to talk some more about this I hope this helps On a somewhat related note we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business such as expert witness testimony and policy issues While we are not afraid to take a point of view as you know we must maintain a neutral and independent posture This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron 1 We have examined Joskow and FERC s analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment without impinging on our core business or becoming an expert witness We think a workshop similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work where we would present our findings and issue a report 2 We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university Again the reults would go to our clients but could be released to a wider audience and a workshop might help highlight the release Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort but the work would be CERA s independent research and we would stand fully behind it Hope all is well Peter ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"paugustini@cera.com","sent_time":"2001-03-30

NY ECT ECT Ann M Schmidt Corp Enron ENRON Subject Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy KEELER EDITS Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann s eBiz request Comments welcome The President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy His decision was based on some very important factors the nation s energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate and U S regulation of CO2 in the near term could be ill advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U S should treat CO2 emissions in the long term as his statement did provoke a very negative anti environment reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long term economic scientific and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions The President s position on CO2 notwithstanding Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market We are well positioned through our experience with low carbon fuels for electric generation natural gas and wind in particular our focus on new power generation and tecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market based cost effective way If we re able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants NOx SO2 and mercury and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology we ll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not In the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market driven solutions to the world s energy and environmental problems ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"catherine.mckalip-thompson@enron.com","sent_time":"2001-03-25

cgi bin article cgi file chronicle archive 2001 03 25 M N30195 DTL Gov Gray Davis faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers electricity bills is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve The Chronicle has learned Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so called structured rate system Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the 10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California s near bankrupt utilities If so the officials warned that consumers electricity rates could double In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co this would mean customers average monthly power bills would rise from 60 to 120 Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way We re going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said Larry Webster a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel It s a dime If you re going to use it let s pay for it Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double The figures reported in the press he said were wildly high The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure Maviglio said Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities you can t conclude anything The state is negotiating a multibillion dollar bailout package with PG E and Southern California Edison Co to relieve the utilities of about 13 billion in debt PG E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall said John Nelson a PG E spokesman Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up The disparity is too large Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California s energy situation to ratepayers and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor COST VS OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills I don t like either choice said Janet Leroux facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store But I guess I d go with higher rates I sure didn t like the blackouts Publicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within the existing rate structure a stealthy way of saying that January s 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place But privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years sources said Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards For the good of California it s inevitable said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy industry association Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer he d be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on It s like gasoline he said I don t like paying higher prices for gasoline but that s the price of doing business Ratepayers draw the line though at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent If it was 20 percent I d probably do it said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty But if it was more like 50 percent I d rather go with rolling blackouts I d rather have blackouts agreed Jenny Soghomonian owner of a shoe repair shop in San Francisco s Financial District I don t want to pay rates that are so much higher NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts they aren t willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way Yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said Tom Higgins senior vice president of Edison International parent company of Southern California Edison Simply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to do so Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response requiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures It adjusts consumer behavior Higgins said People want to get their bills back down RATES EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer It s intellectually dishonest to think there s any other way out of this Higgins said Consumer activists initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear No no no No bailout No rate increases No secret deals said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica We need to get back to a regulated system Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor s ointment He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re regulating California s power market if Davis cannot find a consumer friendly way out of the current fix Because of Rosenfield s past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates which delivered about 800 million to consumers his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento We ve paid too much already Rosenfield said A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation which was a 20 percent rate decrease However when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor s staff Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric Big users should pay more he said after a moment s reflection I m open to a tiered system but only if it s fair Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January s 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday That increase originally was given only a three month duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months if not longer PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said People who use a whole lot of power should pay more The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash poor utilities The state already has spent about 4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more rates will probably be heading up That way you have more convenience and electricity more stability she said But Magee has come up with another solution one that doesn t involve rate increases and rolling blackouts She s moving to Texas Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report E mail David Lazarus at dlazarus sfchronicle com 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page A

Enron Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron Subject FERC s marketing affiliate conference Becky and I attended FERC s gas marketing affiliate conference last week Non affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue but it is not a marketing affiliate issue as anyone can do it FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance but in a non public way There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr 30 I would like to put the following in these comments Evidence of affiliate abuse preference is just not there The best folks can do is make up stuff We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors The FERC rules and the information reported with a caveat under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence That said the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data which is not currently the case We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid This was a deal brought up in the conference Let me know how this sounds Thanks

see a couple of significant problems My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force Also I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months if then We should fill this position immediately We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant As for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep Tom Delay s office Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles seems trustworthy and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio Drew has strong networking skills which I think would nicely fit with Tom s strategic and technical skills The second candidate is John Shelk whom I have known for nearly 15 years John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent John left the Committee in 1992 Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates probably John to that slot That said please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"linda.robertson@enron.com","sent_time":"2001-03-14

for the IOUs as a group Does this cause you any concerns Incidentally we may step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the situation out here Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating what we do with any of your folks in DC 2 One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA Administrator For a variety of reasons there really aren t any good candidates from the Northwest and we re probably all to close to the situation anyway I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration 3 With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra we would very much like the ability to use Enron Online for

structure along with categories of experts and proposed names is attached below We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year inviting the Enron executive committee and board of directors as well as the Corporate Responsibility task force to engage in a dialogue We plan to present a slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16 Thanks for your consideration ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"kelly.kimberly@enron.com","sent_time":"2001-03-02

explore how the DC Office can plug in on the advance planning of Ken s DC trips As we get things organized here I want to do a better job of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town This is hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements I do not want to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enron s presence in DC What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news sources today that Ken is giving a speech participating via panel at the Club for Growth s event tomorrow morning at 10 a m in Senate Dirksen We have been busily planning all of Enron executives trips to the inaugural and I thought I had something of a handle on each executive s itinerary So this came as a surprise A second problem with this is that it is being hosted by Craig Shirley Associates I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our tactics and strategies on electric restructuring Ken may not know this relationship Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his attention I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively add our input

the end of the day the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold another meeting with the CEOs Governor Davis and various other Government officials Governor Davis refused to come to California so a video conference was set up with two locations one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage It was tentatively set up for 2 30 pm CST I have had no reports on the meeting yet Ken Lay Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron Long Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm It includes a draft RFO draft standard contract a table of utilties needs products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1 Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome however given the absence of any buy in or participation by the State of California Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday Major Issues State interest in resolving State willingness to raise retail rates Utilties desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager Willingness to call off the dogs for the suppliers and to release them from legal action State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation Next Steps If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the week of Jan 15 If agreement is reached a massive amount of work is required immediately such as FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16 RFO completion and release by Jan 18 Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 2 Preparation of contract between utilities and state probably DWR Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this

comments/suggestions","message_body":"We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governor s staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governor s ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor s comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utility owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at 3000MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in 1 the buy down of significant demand 2 the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain 3 getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4 setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost plus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UC CSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand in state gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works Jeff someone in Schroeder s group should be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators Securitize uncollected power purchase costs To dos Jeff again I d like to prevail on you to assemble the group s thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak off peak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

to Mark Metts Mark Schroeder ECT 12 18 2000 05 10 AM To Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron cc Subject water opportunity I meant to send you an article some time ago on the UK water business now cannot find it I do not make it my habit to follow this sector and we have never discussed my following this here in the UK However I just wanted you to be aware and you can pass along as you see fit that recent developments in the UK water sector should create new business opportunities for Wessex and indeed trade press here reports as much I am also not trying to end run either Colin Skellett CEO or Keith Harris reg affaris at Wessex both of whom I have a high regad for just wanted to get this into the right circles The development is the mutualisation of water distribution companies This was proposed last year by Kelda in England and turned down by the water regulator It is essentially securitising the future income streams of the pipes business servicing bonds and making the customers the owners there is essentially no equity stake Thus the license obligation to invest in infrastructure is on the customers themselves raises interesting enforcement problems The services part of the business is outsourced on a competitive basis this is where Wessex would come in As I noted such a proposal has previously been rejected Now though it is proposed to mutualise the Welsh water company Normally the regulator would reject this for being unsound along the same lines as the earlier proposal However the leaders of this mutualisation effort in Wales are 200 of the great and the good leaders of the Welsh business community and it is seen as a source of Welsh national pride to take back ownership of their water industry i e meaning it is going to happen We now have a new water regulator who is smart enough not to stand in the way of Welsh politics and has said he thinks the proposal has some merit and he will look not reject it out of hand Wessex could bid on the services agreement for this company and if approved this mutualisation will open the door for others to follow and and hence more opportunities for Wessex Hope this is of some interest and use to you mcs

Enron ENRON Cynthia Sandherr Corp Enron ENRON Allison Navin Corp Enron ENRON Subject Re pipeline aftermath Clayton Here are some preliminary answers to your questions and I have copied GPG and Government Affairs folks as well to share this information 1 I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re election and it is a big vacation week for staff but here s what I am hearing As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer s liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA SENATE In June Senators John McCain R AZ and Slade Gorton R WA led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S 2438 out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate Because of the hasty way in which S 2438 was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made mostly things that were deal breakers for industry Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott R MS Kay Bailey Hutchison R TX John Breaux D LA and Sam Brownback R KS From what I ve learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident the El Paso incident just reinforces those The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain Gorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor HOUSE The House is moving a bit more slowly but again I d expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks R NJ Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor I m told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with and something more reasonable than the McCain bill With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so we ll have to see what kind of hand we re dealt in the next few weeks Overall I d expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious time Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that they ve done something about this terrible tragedy With that said there s still not that much time to get legislation through so I d say that there s still a chance it may not get done this year If I had to attach a number to it I d say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50 60 2 Gas supply to California I ll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you All I ve heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly I m sure the power crunch in California will put some counter pressure on but I just don t have good intelligence on this yet With all this said I m on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I ve taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week If you have questions please

commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them This is sounder than running huge deferrals deficits to be later recovered from consumers Rate relief should be

Palmer Corp Enron ENRON Steven J Kean NA Enron Enron Tim Belden HOU ECT ECT Subject Re Daily Update Legislative activity 08 24 00 I attended Cmmr Wood s two day hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today 8 24 in San Diego Three Commissioner s were present Wood Lynch and Neeper with Duque and Bilas participating by phone Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken The quasi legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale retail markets This session focused on Wholesale markets There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present He relayed FERC s concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority The format of the hearing was to respond to pre filed questions developed by Wood Lynch Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney No questions were posed by members of the audience Yesterday s panel of academics were comprised of 1 Dr Timothy Duane UC Berkley 2 Dr William Hogan Harvard 3 Dr Frank Wolak Stanford ISO Market Surveillance Committee 4 David Marcus Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5 Dr Gene Coyle 6 Dr Jean Michel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior None with the exception of Dr Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real time market power Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra s interests in mind He continued to promote expansion of the ISO s abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost of service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long run although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego Today s panel included representatives from SDG E SCE and PG E TURN UCAN and ORA While yesterday s panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today s panel made no bones about the generators being to blame SCE PG E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze SDG E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply SDG E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases UCAN discussed the Governor s direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial He mentioned that C I customers are experience difficulties as well TURN raised the need for cost based bid caps and cost based peaking contracts Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission s authority to order retention of assets Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed Bruno Gaillard 08 24 2000 06 09 PM To SF Directors Edward Hamb HOU EES EES

Daily Update Legislative activity 08 24 00 Siting related bills 1 Good new The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34 1 It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing 2 There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970 The enviro s boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley Labor was obstructionist they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants Rate Cap related bills 1 The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it Furthermore there are signs that Gov Davis opposes it 2 The Governor s office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill The language however is not available as of yet It may be released today or tomorrow SDG E has shown concerns over the content of the bill They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6 1 00 The rate cap could reflect Wood s rate cap proposal 6 5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs All of this is speculative We hope to see the actual language soon 3 Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290 The bill focuses only on SDG E customers and our major principals are the following The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31 2001 The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap

have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories California Power Issues National Power Issues and Secured Documents It has then been broken down further into subcategories The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e mail Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop i e principals statements speeches and facts as well as talking points and other

Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison s going to be left dangling In the Senate The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90 likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight without a vote having taking place in any committee Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won t prevent Edison from going bankrupt The key features of the bill are Banks and QFs get paid in full Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it In the Assembly The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg s the likely winner That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today We re attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later The Assembly likely won t vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest The Problem The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem in short the bills are two ships passing in the night The Democratic leaders Governor Hertzberg Burton aren t talking and Burton hasn t expressed any interest in talking to anybody The likely outcome given the circumstances Burton says he s done what he needs to do i e passed out a fair bill the Assembly and Senate can t agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison s left twisting That said there s still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim In short little has changed since yesterday Best Jeff

advice.","message_body":"The letter looks good A couple of comments for your consideration On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don t fit into it Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive The generation and sales business has a competitive structure i e relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service Because regulators don t set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing I can just see the press seizing on Enron s claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public s resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances

San Francisco Chronicle 20 URL 20 http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file 3D chronicle archive 2001 07 04 M N186091 DTL 20 Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal 20 regulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly 20 imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat o f 20 blackouts in the two states 20 The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling 20 blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the first ever rolling 20 blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy hungry casinos to shut off fountains a nd 20 reduce air conditioning 20 The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a 20 closer look at the so called price mitigation plan and come up with revisio ns 20 that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during 20 shortages 20 We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for t he 20 California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of 20 dollars to keep the state s lights on 20 Generators need to be held accountable he said 20 The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet 20 power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below market rat es 20 during periods of high demand 20 Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the 20 expense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that 20 electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost 20 No one s going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said 20 Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an 20 energy industry association in Menlo Park 20 Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no 20 economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price control s 20 are in effect 20 This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no t 20 having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts 20 BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1 45 p m yesterday when 20 power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert 20 about an hour later after finding additional supplies 20 Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a 20 spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees 20 the state s power network 20 The Golden State s latest brush with lights out conditions came a day after 20 Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting 20 heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their 20 lights 20 Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said tha t 20 the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they 20 are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in 20 exacerbating Monday s shortage 20 We re looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potenti al 20 for unintended consequences 20 Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less 20 efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing 20 under capped prices 20 We re going to see how the caps might have played into this he said 20 The federal ceiling in 10 Western states excluding California is about 9 2 20 per megawatt hour In California a 10 percent surcharge is added because o f 20 the state s credit risk bringing the price to just over 101 20 Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha ve 20 extended California s power crisis to neighboring states 20 California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said 20 LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES 20 California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith 20 that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federa l 20 regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot 20 withhold output 20 The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan 20 said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources 20 Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue 20 that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal 20 regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supp ly 20 and demand determine costs 20 Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac k 20 on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line numb er 20 provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies 20 No one answered he said They were closed 20 State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the 20 commission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for 20 when the commission might come up with a response 20 E mail David Lazarus at dlazarus sfchronicle com 20 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page A 1 20 Out of state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer Published July 3 2001 20 Confused by the federal government s new controls on electricity prices 20 generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state 20 was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said 20 The confusion began when the state s electric grid operators declared a Sta ge 20 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the fir st 20 time since they went into effect June 21 20 Out of state generators pulled about 1 500 megawatts of electricity off the 20 table at midafternoon enough to power about 1 1 million homes because of 20 uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy 20 Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for 20 the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity fo r 20 the state s financially distressed utilities 20 They didn t understand what they were going to be paid there was confusio n 20 over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw 1 500 megawatts disappear 20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced 20 California to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said 20 Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada 20 Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a 20 variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power 20 market But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiti ng 20 profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity 20 And as Monday s episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap 20 will fall could lead to unexpected shortages 20 That s the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur O Donnell 20 editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind o f 20 certainty at all 20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last minute import s 20 from the Bonne 0F ville Power Administration the federal agency that marke ts 20 government produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The state 20 went into a Stage 2 power alert the next to last level before blackouts ar e 20 ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon 20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8 20 FERC imposed a round the clock ceiling on power throughout the West The 20 price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least efficient 20 plant operating in California during a power alert declared by the 20 Independent System Operator which runs the state s power transmission grid 20 When there s no alert prices can t exceed 85 percent of the cap that was 20 established during the latest alert 20 Until Monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatt hour i n 20 California But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early 20 afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 20 percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said 20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many 20 California power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew 20 by how much until the price was posted by the ISO 20 The ceiling for California fell to about 77 at 3 p m but was back up to 98 20 in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the 10 percent 20 premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there s a cred it 20 risk in selling to the state 20 O Donnell said it s likely suppliers will pull back from the market every 20 time the ISO declares a power alert 20 In state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO Bu t 20 out of state suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the 20 out of staters that were pulling back Hidalgo said

sell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn t get it 20 By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer 20 SACRAMENTO Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted 20 several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday 20 afternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to 20 supply more than 1 million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the 20 California Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the 20 state s electricity since January At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us 20 that since they don t know what they re going to get paid they re not goin g 20 to take the risk and so they re not going to sell the energy Hart said The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in 20 summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency 20 meaning reserves had dipped below 7 It was the first such emergency since 20 May 31 Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 20 intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a pow er 20 emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that 20 applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona 20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th e 20 most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California 20 grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is 20 supposed to be established under the commission s order and that apparentl y 20 drove away sellers Hart said Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1 30 p m putting 20 the old price limit of 90 per megawatt hour in question companies that ha d 20 committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon 20 backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of 20 Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of 20 the San Diego based energy conglomerate Forced to dip even deeper into the state s power reserves and declare a 20 Stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy 20 commission s hotline for clarification about what the new price should be a nd 20 when it should take effect They got no answer Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to 20 clarify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations pow er 20 suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when i t 20 is set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatt hour because the price 20 of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped latel y Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators 20 had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in 20 part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had 20 agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower 20 each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later thi s 20 summer Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said 20 Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times 20 James D Steffes 07

your discussion regarding the reregulation threat at the next meeting Below are some of my observations While it s premature to say we have an energy crisis we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices spiking electricity prices and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season I ll send along some of the data There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush s ties to big oil which includes us by the way though we produce nary a drop and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy though at least so far the dominant characteristic of the administration s policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market Notwithstanding the issue s potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press many Americans seem blissfully ignorant at least on the electricity issue We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes and most people knew nothing about it So while the issue has the potential for political traction it may not have caught on yet except in places like San Diego and New York city The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets Investigations of out of state price gougers and profiteers have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place They have not worked at least in wholesale markets Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West power flows out of California to those other markets Ironically though I can t explain it in classical economic terms the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply For the most part though the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow so far Outside of California the authors of other states deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California s Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why California won t happen here For the most part then the reaction to California has been positive from Enron s perspective in states that have already deregulated There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans e g utility plant divestiture may be postponed or cancelled The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans I think it s off the agenda in most places The fact that most of the major markets about 70 of total electric revenue are already deregulated deregulating is a blessing in that regard At the federal level there has been a combination of the burn the village in order to save it approach allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program and a more positive call for comprehensive reform All in all I believe we re OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity business is booming we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action Our target has been FERC they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner s vote away from taking action to further open the market Enron s response Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message our concern was that Enron a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle It s fair to say that they fumbled the ball they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message We are now working the issue directly We are working the issue on a number of levels 1 PR we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers As time goes on the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better 2 Govt relations we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California the market wants to build capacity but the government won t let it This may be the best environment we ll ever see for streamlining the permitting process Also in typical Enron fashion we put a deal on the table We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians SDG E dropped the ball unfortunately Instead of seizing the opportunity they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account At the federal level we are contacting members the DOE and FERC Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish leveling the playing field in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed Additionally we are developing a prepackaged system including software for nondiscriminatory open access to take away any lingering excuses or delays 3 Overall messaging we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working Overall we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices particularly natural gas The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet natural gas is producing such outsized prices The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre deregulation long term prices are also lower than historical levels the curve is backwardated sp meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs this begs the question why didn t the market react sooner and avoid the spike When all else fails a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC We haven t had this thrown at us yet but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready This is just the tip of the iceberg The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together Let me know if there is anything else you need ","message_mailbox":"kean-s","recipient_address":"robert_zoellick@gmfus.org, stelzer@aol.com","sent_time":"2000-08-29

yesterday and your asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron s Washington office Although until that moment I hadn t thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter In recalling our conversation I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron To whom does Joe Hillings report to you or to Terry Thorne You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron to whom does she report Then there is Joe Allen whom I have known since our days in the Legislature doesn t he also handle Texas affairs I am sorry I didn t ask you all this on Tuesday Whatever the answers it s clear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq which is why it would be a very exciting place to work Thanks again for your call your courtesy and your indulgence with this tardy line of questioning With best

Way Status The fat lady hasn t quite sung yet but I thought it would be a good idea to give you a readout on the current status of the BLM USFS fiber optic right of way issue In a nutshell our strategy seems to have worked and we ve won all the concessions we sought As you ll recall these were a to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications and a later version that re packaged the issue mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting b to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments the first such assessment which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold c to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001 and d to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders including Enron Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above and have agreed to points c and d The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill which has been agreed to by the Conferees forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001 and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally challenged women is because the issue still hasn t quite closed The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed But since our issue was settled at the staff level and is now off the table we re likely to remain safe from being re examined and challenged In fact any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months Through outside consultants we ve had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward Details are forthcoming but Enron would be involved closely in the process The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded and are now more than willing to negotiate But the bottom line again is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now which they originally intended to do or in the coming fiscal year And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House and organizing and leading the 20 member Fiber Optic Public Land Right of Way Coalition we ve succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field Steve

went forward on the high tech letter Let me know if you have any questions or comments Sarah September 26 2000 The Honorable James Hoecker Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street N E Washington D C Re Electric Power Industry Reform Dear Chairman Hoecker We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power We write to urg e 20 you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable 20 shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in t he 20 electric power industry It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulato ry 20 Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a 20 competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply 20 of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that t he 20 power supply in the U S remains sufficient and is available at reasonable 20 prices For example you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in t he 20 nation 01 s electricity gird Under the current system FERC regulations a llow 20 many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their 20 transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers The result of this 20 policy is shortages blackouts and skyrocketing prices Like the interstat e 20 highway system FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to 20 another just as freely as motorists do All electricity suppliers should 20 have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to 20 where it is most needed FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers 01 reliance on spot and 20 short term electricity markets for power supply Instead FERC should urge 20 suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long term 20 contracts Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers 20 from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these 20 reforms Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more 20 reliable and economical 20 Very truly yours

current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid The answer is open access so power can get from where it is to where it is needed This has been clear for a long time yet the current

seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs PG E and SoCalGas that would give ENA access to their assets In short ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs core gas load i e rez and small commercial customers ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core s assets upstream of the city gate We re meeting with Sempra s Chief Regulatory Office Bill Reed and Sempra s CFO next Thursday to discuss Given the fact that Sempra s primarily focused on electricity the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer For electricity the plan has two pieces 1 a commodity offer that beats the 6 5 cent cap i e nothing fancy and 2 Deal Bench services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG E that the California PUC could pre approve thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG E now faces Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions We ll distribute the slides we re putting together as soon as they re drafted hopefully by COB Friday Best Jeff

a hard look at who is contributing and who isn t etc My agenda would be 1 What can be done to increase the value to Enron As I see it we have two purposes to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important fora and to enrich management s understanding of the outside world what it is like and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces 2 What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss in 2001 as best we can judge things at this early point in time 3 What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001 given whatever we decide in 1 and 2

the feet of California s own decisions about market structure It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds On the other hand the Commission s order to be

Subject Possible Harvard Business School event Steve Wanted to thank you again for reviewing the strategy as simple rules article It is forthcoming in the next Harvard Business Review and will send you some reprints once the magazine hits the newsstands Also wanted to gauge your interest in a possible even at the Harvard Business School in April 2001 We are currently finalizing our plans for the Entrepreneurial Manager a first year course on entrepreneurship taken by all 1 000 of our MBA students As part of the course we will feature an entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course Last year we featured Intuit taught an Intuit case study and hosted Scott Cook who spoke to the entire MBA class The session was a huge success the highest rated class in our course and had a lasting impact on how our students think about entrepeneurship We were wondering whether you and your colleagues might be interested in being our featured company this year If you decided to proceed we would first write a case study focused on the process of creating new ventures within Enron The case would probably consist of three portions an overview of the Enron corporation an in depth description of one or two ventures successfully formed in the past and a profile of someone currently attempting to start a new venture within Enron In preparing the case we would draw heavily on existing case studies articles and book chapters profiling Enron to avoid duplicating effort We would then supplement our desk research by interviewing approximately 15 20 Enron employees including top management team members especially Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling some folks involved in past ventures and the people currently attempting to start a new venture Each interview would take approximately 60 minutes We could probably complete the bulk of the interviews in a two to three day visit to Enron supplemented by telephone interviews The ideal timing for these interviews from our perspective would be the last week of November or the first few weeks of December We would then return to Boston write a draft of the case and then submit that to you for review and clearance in January We could then make any last minute changes before distributing the case to the students for the April discussion In addition to writing the case study we would like to invite a group of Enron executives to HBS when we discuss the case in April The ideal date would be the 27th of April but we could schedule the Enron day the 23rd 24th or 25th if the 27th were impossible for you Last year Intuit sent along six folks some junior some senior each of whom sat in at least one of our class discussions In addition Scott Cook spoke to the entire MBA class We would like to follow the same format this year so it would be super if either Jeff or Ken or in the best of all worlds both could speak to the MBAs as a whole With Intuit last year we kicked off at about 8 30 and wrapped everything up by approximately 1 00 We would shoot for roughly similar timing this year Many of our students equate entrepreneurship with start ups and this day is designed to show them that it is possible although extremely difficult for large companies to be entrepreneurial As such you and your colleagues would be providing an invaluable service to our students and we would be deeply grateful for your contribution The event might also have some direct benefits to Enron in terms of increased profile among our students If you were interested we could also explore opportunities to leverage this event to further increase Enron s profile as a leader of the New Economy We might for instance bundle the case study with a teaching note and edited video as a module on entrepreneurship in large companies and distribute it to other business schools through Harvard Business School press My colleagues and I would be most grateful for your cooperation and would be happy to explore ways that you might increase your return on the time invested Please let me know if this opportunity might be of interest to you and your colleagues and how you would like to proceed I very much look forward to hearing from you

here I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge though and will lead to expectations which may not be met I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one I would go to a pure number system We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong in which case I think it s ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher You don t get that in an absolute system with preset expectations I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work and punishing those who don t play well so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly I agree with Paul s points about giving clear specific feed back though I don t think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously I m not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger

issues we need to look into Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements He asked if knowing this would change any of our views esp peaking plants though I suspect it s already too late for that My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this exemption for bilateral transactions won t matter much but let s think it through Is EOL or APX an alternative Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments Specifically has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development In addition to any other points we might make I think we should argue that PJMing the market won t facilitate and may even hinder forward market development Also we should advocate actions by FERC that take away second guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here or we should take the approach I took in my testimony FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible Finally on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate Analogy if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices acquiring supplies or running the market it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized Those functions should be left to the market Mary Hain ECT 11 10 2000 11 13 AM To

need you to run these items by Rick I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO In the wake of Seattle and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going If we have specifically committed to certain things then let s follow through If there are things we can avoid let s avoid them Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel With respect to the Hills firm can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions These are the kinds of things we need to consider Joe Hillings ENRON 04 19 2000 04 13 AM To Steven J Kean HOU EES EES cc Subject Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO Steve This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for your consideration and decision We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually I m not quite certain that is possible at this stage you need to know the following The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva Committee on Specific Committments spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS General Agreement on Trade and Services The USTR raised the issue tabled the issue and guided the discussion We did not send anyone to that session As planned for several months we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization He raised the issue of Japan s industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle Now he has told Bob Vastine president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement We ll hear more tonight Later today the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance This is a decision point for you We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it the SCO FSN Showcase Europe in Houston with you and Rick you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union They are important points of contact for our commercial people This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later I have organized the dinner Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives This is a dialogue on energy services The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy Rick s memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC Therefore unless we participate Europe s energy industry is not talking with US industry If this is what you want then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth Secretary General of the BIAC Business Industry Affairs Committee to the OECD This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e commerce and services Doug an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future I had planned to be there with Ken for the day day and a half he will be in Paris I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us Well these are the near term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm However if you want to exit other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision Joe

fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted California has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices That s not good for consumers If they need a lower cost solution for consumers or protection from price volatility in the meantime they need to outsource the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids Regardless of how we frame the arguments or the solutions however we have to make the public policy consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral

adamson frontier economics com tburns gpc ca aleck trawick blakes com dpef blakes com cc Subject Update Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes importers excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk for a period of two weeks During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a problem that requires emergency amendments to the Pool rules Our position has been that Alberta is short supply and significant changes to the rules and or market design will only discourage new generation development Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4 5 stakeholders which would include Enron to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules Dale said he would try to pull together a terms of reference document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow After my call with Dale McMaster Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas 1 Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron s participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron s participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis 2 Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes i would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market ii would be contrary to the development of an efficient fair and openly competitive market for electricity iii would compromise the independence of the Power Pool and iv would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo they will prepare a memo for Enron advising i whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta and ii whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA 3 Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse i e appeal to the AEUB and or legal action in the Court of Queen s Bench in the event the proposed rule changes or similar changes are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies Please advise if you have any comments Regards

Knowledge Management infrastructure You and I have shared some thoughts on these subjects Properly managed these are potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative I know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas Among the several benefits a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both development and maintenance costs Also we would eliminate duplications and give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize corporate branding I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy Nevertheless I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this position My relationship with business units has given me a unique education I have developed information value chain built and managed three websites in three different operating companies At all times my products were considered benchmarks In addition I shall be able to manage potential political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation I should be grateful if you would think about this Once again thank you for your time Tony Enron

Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes Thanks for your comments Steve The legal arguments are one piece of our 5 point action plan it relates to action items 2 3 and 4 that I outlined in my November 13 e mail to the group Action item 1 and I agree this must be our primary focus is to communicate to the Alberta Government i Enron s views on what mistakes are being made by governments in other jurisdictions in response to high price levels and ii Enron s plans for Alberta if the Alberta Government stays the course and does not interfere in the market We are hopeful this can be done through Milnthorp and Delainey meeting with Premier Klein and or Minister Cardinal If such a meeting isn t possible we will simply have to get the message through to them via lower level officials in the Alberta Government On Tuesday Rob Milnthorp left messages for Premier Klein the Premier s Chief of Staff and Minister Cardinal and the Cardinal s Deputy Minister Ken Smith I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD The speaking points that we prepared to guide us through these calls are as follows Enron understands that electricity prices in Alberta are an important issue for the Government Enron has concerns with a number of recent rule and market design developments in the electricity market Enron feel that it would be helpful for the President and CEO of Enron North America and Rob M to sit down for a brief meeting with the Premier and Minister Cardinal to 1 Explain Enron s current plans to expand commercial operations in both the electricity and natural gas sectors 2 Express Enron s concerns that the Alberta electricity market may not indeed be open for business given recent developments including i The MAP and its adverse effect on the PPA Buyers and the no harm commitment ii Power Pool rule changes of the sort recently proposed will irreparably damage existing suppliers such as Enron the ultimate effect of which will undoubtedly be the lack of development of much needed new supply and longer term high prices for consumers 3 Express Enron s willingness to draw on our experience in other markets and explain our vision of how the Government can work through this difficult period in the shortest possible time frame Ken Smith returned Milnthorp s call this morning and Rob Milnthorp advised that he covered each of the above speaking points and the conversation went very well Smith asked him what would you do if you were us and Rob replied that the Government must stay the course as the alternatives will make the situation worse Rob also told Smith that Enron s preference is to continue to work with the Government on these difficult issues and Enron doesn t like sending letters that threaten legal action to the Government or the Power Pool especially since we share a common vision on electricity restructuring with the Alberta Government Smith indicated that with the Alberta Legislature back in session it would be difficult to get a meeting for us with the Premier but he would try to do so and would get back to Milnthorp Whether we get a meeting with the Premier or not we still need to prepare a new briefing note for the government within the next week and at the very least Rob Milnthorp and I can meet with Larry Charach and Ken Smith to walk them through this document As you say our document must focus on the adverse effect on consumers and the implications of the Government moving off the strategy it continues to publicly support the Premier said again this week in question period that the problem is that we are short supply which is to allow the market to work Regards Rob From Steven J Kean ENRON on 11 15 2000 07 13 PM CST To Robert Hemstock CAL ECT ECT cc Subject Re Update Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes congratulations One thing to add to the arguments we have to make the adverse effect on consumers the centerpiece of our arguments We need the legal arguments too but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven discussion We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have to allow a true market price to be posted California has seen the cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply because they have tried to artificially constrain prices That s not good for consumers If they need a lower cost solution for consumers or protection from price volatility in the meantime they need to outsource the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids Regardless of how we frame the arguments or the solutions however we have to make the public policy consumer protection arguments the center of our written and oral presentations Do you agree Robert

gpc ca aleck trawick blakes com dpef blakes com cc Subject Update Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes importers excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk for a period of two weeks During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a problem that requires emergency amendments to the Pool rules Our position has been that Alberta is short supply and significant changes to the rules and or market design will only discourage new generation development Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4 5 stakeholders which would include Enron to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules Dale said he would try to pull together a terms of reference document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow After my call with Dale McMaster Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas 1 Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron s participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron s participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis 2 Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes i would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market ii would be contrary to the development of an efficient fair and openly competitive market for electricity iii would compromise the independence of the Power Pool and iv would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo they will prepare a memo for Enron advising i whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta and ii whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA 3 Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse i e appeal to the AEUB and or legal action in the Court of Queen s Bench in the event the proposed rule changes or similar changes are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies Please advise if you have any comments Regards Rob

with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work Also it s worth noting that the deregulated market did work Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation Enron hedged

letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron s contribution to the US Chamber to 100 000 I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member My reservation about the Chamber is that they won t take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few Electric restructuring was a key example of this There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a process Naturally all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote The vote supported wholesale but not retail reform with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery Afterwards the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation though this is not exclusively the Chamber s fault Unfortunately Tom s forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset For Enron it s a bit like paying 100 000 for a veto right The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes things they will push for whether we pay dues or not and things we will add our separate voice to in any event As I have explained to the Chamber Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom changing the way markets work and dislocating incumbents Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us They represent the status quo in the business community Tom is an extremely promising leader he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community A voice which stands for moving business to the next level not just protecting its current position Having said all that the Chamber particularly its international chapters has been useful to us in the past In previous years Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders As a consequence I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues and policy participation level but with continuing access to their international activities I suggested something in the 25 000 range That s why they are approaching you they want us to double our current dues to 100 000 Currently I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson I am interested in your insights or if you prefer you can simply refer them to Linda or me

holding the most talented managers and directors ie we re OK at the top livels already Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels We may need to weed out the

Parquet SF ECT E CT 09 09 Subject Re Options the Governor s Considering Jeff Dasovich and I along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis 20 staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two polic y 20 advisors on energy issues They made the following points The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity 20 issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but 20 they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls 20 a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market a thinly veiled 20 reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room The Governor s view is that all participants regulators utilities 20 customers and generators must behave responsibly Everyone must share the pain The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature 20 returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati ve 20 proposals in the next couple of weeks While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the 20 attached e mail were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was 20 fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of 20 new information The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments 20 about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmissi on 20 siting a real retail market to promote demand side responses etc The 20 staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu t 20 remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a nd 20 remain subject to rate caps possible restrictions on sales outside the sta te 20 at least at peak times etc One approach they appear to be toying with is 20 a share the pain proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th e 20 deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo rm 20 of higher rates That leaves generators who they might want to either 20 agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going forward prices The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions but the Davis 20 administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the 20 problem 20 I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight We should as 20 always provide consistent and reasonable solutions I think we should 20 prepare a document for distribution to staff legislators and anyone else 20 that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar d 20 eg in Belden s presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper and wraps 20 them in a more political context In other words we have already 20 articulated the right answers we now need to put a political rationale 20 around our proposals a set of arguments which responds directly to the 20 political opposition those answers are likely to encounter Jeff will foll ow 20 up with one of the staff members in particular Kari Dohn and I would 20 suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary politica l 20 rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed 09Jeff Dasovich 09Sent by Jeff Dasovich 0911 22 2000 04 00 PM 09 09 20 09 09 To skean enron com Richard Shapiro NA Enron Enron

Governor 01 s 20 staff next Monday November 27th The following are some options which the Governor 01 s office is consideri ng 20 IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics IEP would 20 like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday November 27th to 20 discuss the Governor 01 s meeting Please advise us as to whether your hav e 20 been invited and who you are sending California 01 s electricity supply situation has two inter related problems 01 20 1 high wholesale electricity costs and 2 marginally adequate supply of 20 generation 01 both have combined to create a dysfunctional wholesale 20 electricity market The goals should be To assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest 20 reasonable cost o Consider requiring that all in state generation be sold in state o Consider re asserting state authority over the operation maintenance and 20 safety practices of all in state generating facilities 01 for public healt h and 20 safety purposes o Consider developing a state power authority to build generation and 20 own operate transmission o Consider requiring utilities both to retain existing and to build new 20 generation o Consider providing utilities with authority to stabilize retail prices to 20 be paid by consumers through development of an energy portfolio that reduce s 20 exposure to spot markets including contracting forward for much more of 20 their unmet power needs o Consider extending consumer rate freeze o Consider centralizing power plant dispatch like the other ISOs in the res t 20 of the country o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a stat e 20 or private entity that can acquire the transmission facilities and control 20 the electricity transmission grid MUNIs have proposed this o Consider sponsoring supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX board s 20 to increase accountability o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand 20 reduction and on longer term broader based programs o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities to 20 streamline permitting and to develop renewable resources o Call for sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices o Pressure the FERC to do its job to 1 bring about responsible seller 20 behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other 20 market interventions as necessary and 2 provide refunds to affected 20 consumers

a cocktail function to be held by a senior Japanese political figure this evening Timing for approval is at issue We have been invited by Mr Kamei a senior political figure in the LDP to attend a cocktail party this evening The price is Y20 000 about 190 per head and we were proposing to send two people My rough estimate is that half of each ticket would go to the LDP ie a total of 190 We have been developing a good relationship with the LDP through Kamei and most recently he assisted us in arranging a meeting for Ken Lay with the MITI minister Accordingly the purpose of attending is to maintain good relations with the Japanese Government with a view assisting to further Enron Japan s business interests in Japan It would be viewed negatively if we were not to attend We have external legal counsel sign off that this type of function is legal in Japan The function also has the support of Joe Hirl I am aware that there is a procedure for political donations however given the number of Enron hands that the application needs to pass through we will not have approval in time for this evening Hence this note Through the course of today I will seek to get the application approved through Mark Schroeder and John Sherriff and on its way to Elizabeth Labanowski and then to you As mentioned Elizabeth is unlikely to get the application until after the function this evening In the

Nicolay HOU ECT ECT Joe Hartsoe Corp Enron ENRON Shelley Corman ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject Re Draft Talking points about California Gas market Leslie Looks good Just a couple of comments 1 General May want to point out that the roots of California s current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem combined effect of California s import based energy policy and the state s failure to invest in in state infrastructure California imports about 25 of its electricity but about 80 90 percent of its gas supply California has failed to invest in the in state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade So we ve got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in state transportation once you get into California The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place Can we support that suggestion and is it one that we want to make necessarily If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices do we need to propose ways to eliminate it Otherwise seems that we may be giving FERC ammunition to take action without trying to steer that action in the right direction Maybe I m reading too much into the bullet 2 Specific Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly The midwest via Alliance is competing away Canadian gas The Southwest Nevada Arizona is

reliability only legislation I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it If it gets through committee

get other Members to swing him We trust he ll come up with a sensible face saving compromise on his own eg formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight at this point our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue We continue though on several other fronts 1 We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS 2 We ve increased the pressure on the White House and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion BLM Forest Service have not gotten the message Our position is that we ll be satisfied that they ve changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt Hood EBS build is retracted 3 We re preparing both Senate and House

view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won t prevent Edison from going bankrupt The key features of the bill are Banks and QFs get paid in full Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it In the Assembly The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg s the likely winner That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today We re attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later The Assembly likely won t vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest The Problem The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem in short the bills are two ships passing in the night The Democratic leaders Governor Hertzberg Burton aren t talking and Burton hasn t expressed any interest in talking to anybody The likely outcome given the circumstances Burton says he s done what he needs to do i e passed out a fair bill the Assembly and Senate can t agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison s left twisting That said there s still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim In short little has changed since yesterday Best Jeff

advice.","message_body":"The letter looks good A couple of comments for your consideration On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an d then argue that we don t fit into it Would it be worth explaining why t hat makes sense Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competit ive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses Economic reg ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution The competitive market can not be solely relie d upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distrib ution utilities Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set p ricing and other terms of service What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers The same public policie s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive The generation and sales business has a competitive structure i e relativ ely low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect t o rates and terms of service They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other re tailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions Com petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a nd terms of service Because regulators don t set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents h ave a habit of doing I can just see the press seizing on Enron s clai m of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer cise of prosecutorial discretion I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxerc ise of PD If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we co uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public s resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances

Process","message_body":"see below Federal price limits backfire 20 Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 20 David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer 20 Wednesday July 4 2001 20 2001 San Francisco Chronicle 20 URL http www sfgate com cgi bin article cgi file 3D chronicle archive 20 01 07 04 MN186091 DTL 20 Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal re gulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly impos ed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of bla ckouts in the two states 20 The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling black outs yesterday afternoon and one day after the first ever rolling blackout s in Las Vegas forced energy hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduc e air conditioning 20 The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so called price mitigation plan and come up with revis ions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during s hortages 20 We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for t he California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state s lights on 20 Generators need to be held accountable he said 20 The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below market rat es during periods of high demand 20 Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the ex pense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that electrici ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost 20 No one s going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an e nergy industry association in Menlo Park 20 Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont rols are in effect 20 This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no t having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts 20 BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1 45 p m yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert ab out an hour later after finding additional supplies 20 Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversee s the state s power network 20 The Golden State s latest brush with lights out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li ghts 20 Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said tha t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday s shortage 20 We re looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potenti al for unintended consequences 20 Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishin g under capped prices 20 We re going to see how the caps might have played into this he said 20 The federal ceiling in 10 Western states excluding California is about 9 2 per megawatt hour In California a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state s credit risk bringing the price to just over 101 20 Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha ve extended California s power crisis to neighboring states 20 California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said 20 LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES 20 California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith t hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit hhold output 20 The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources 20 Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal r egulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let suppl y and demand determine costs 20 Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac k on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu mber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge ncies 20 No one answered he said They were closed 20 State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the com mission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for wh en the commission might come up with a response 20 E mail David Lazarus at dlazarus sfchronicle com 20 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Page A 1 20 Out of state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer Published July 3 2001 20 Confused by the federal government s new controls on electricity prices ge nerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state wa s nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said 20 The confusion began when the state s electric grid operators declared a Sta ge 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June 21 20 Out of state generators pulled about 1 500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon enough to power about 1 1 million homes because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity fo r the state s financially distressed utilities 20 They didn t understand what they were going to be paid there was confusio n over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw 1 500 megawatts disappear 20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced Ca lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said Roll ing blackouts hit southern Nevada 20 Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a varia ble price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark et But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting p rofits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity A nd as Monday s episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages 20 That s the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur O Donnell editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of certainty at all 20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last minute import s from the Bonne 07ville Power Administration the federal agency that mark ets government produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The s tate went into a Stage 2 power alert the next to last level before blackou ts are ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon 20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8 20 FERC imposed a round the clock ceiling on power throughout the West The pr ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least efficient p lant operating in California during a power alert declared by the Indepen dent System Operator which runs the state s power transmission grid When there s no alert prices can t exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ ished during the latest alert 20 Until Monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatt hour i n California But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte rnoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said 20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many Calif ornia power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew by h ow much until the price was posted by the ISO 20 The ceiling for California fell to about 77 at 3 p m but was back up to 98 in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there s a cred it risk in selling to the state 20 O Donnell said it s likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t ime the ISO declares a power alert 20 In state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO Bu t out of state suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the ou t of staters that were pulling back Hidalgo said 20 The Bee s Dale Kasler can be reached at 916 321 1066 or dkasler sacbee co m 20 Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs 20 Electricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to s ell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn t get it 20 By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer 20 SACRAMENTO Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af ternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su pply more than 1 million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the stat e s electricity since January At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us t hat since they don t know what they re going to get paid they re not going to take the risk and so they re not going to sell the energy Hart said The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency m eaning reserves had dipped below 7 It was the first such emergency since May 31 Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power e mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona 20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th e most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commission s order and that appare ntly drove away sellers Hart said Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1 30 p m putting the old price limit of 90 per megawatt hour in question companies that h ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of the San Diego based energy conglomerate Forced to dip even deeper into the state s power reserves and declare a Stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commi ssion s hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh en it should take effect They got no answer Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar ify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power s uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when i t is set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatt hour because the pri ce of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped la tely Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had agr eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said 20
