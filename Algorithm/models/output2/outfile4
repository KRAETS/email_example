Enron position will probably be carried in the London books However risk books will still be required in India to determine the net MTM for the 3rd party sales commitments in India These books should include both the intercompany purchase from London and the 3rd party sales The commercial group in India will be responsible for local curves location basis specific usually transportation costs and energy operations this will probably be you initially until the trading activity has grown will be responsible for the deal capture process including contract administration a settlement process and risk management administration daily valuation and reporting of risk books Accounting will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general ledger and financials There will also be a logistics process The following questions need to be addressed With the increased coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be required My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the policy if necessary What trading activities will be performed in India vs London The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure required for the India office Sally s employee starts on Monday I will let you know who she is and arrange a call You can rest assured that although this may seen complicated and it is Sally s Energy Ops team will be able to hold your hand all the way through this process It will be critical that we demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place before we

these items tomorrow Background As a long time supporter of the analyst program I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program I initiated a meeting announced at Rick Causey s staff meeting that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following Brenda Herod ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead LSU Brent Price ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead UT Jeff Sommers CALME Executive Lead Univsersity of Florida Ed Coats Corp Tax Core Team Member UT A M LSU and University of Florida Sally Beck ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead UT and OU Carolyn Barrett EBS Howard Selzer Enron Global E P Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points One program or two Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999 an announcement was made that there would be one analyst program Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed In fact those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting rotations and orientation We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus SIngle start date The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible a concern from our points of view for an innovative company The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May Lack of communication We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP and yet we have received little information or communication about the program We hear rumors of tracks but no facts or details Some of us had heard about the single July start date and some had not Commercial focus too heavy Presentation materials the attitudes of support staff in the Associates Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs without understanding support needs Lack of input from biggest supporters Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP we are concerned that we haven t been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program We are concerned that decisions example the single start date are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us MSAP has taken a step backward Previously with a dedicated leadership team and staff the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts the quality of candidates the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program Summary Concerns Discussion Points Disc ","message_subject":"Discussion Points for Meeting on Analyst

discuss our recommendations I would not anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue However I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients until after

of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction for Michael Jordan which may involve a short stint for him in Houston My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance training and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000 I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry Richard and some of their direct reports I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products I have not heard from Tani but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey s desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley next week is the best for me to be in London I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London I look forward to meeting with you next week This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton s request By circumstance as you know we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt There will be a similar review of Continental power UK gas UK power and global liquids The review teams are currently focused on operations controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies so I will have those forwarded to you today The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday I can also provide you with a draft of that report the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week he made the trip but was out of the office last week We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation
