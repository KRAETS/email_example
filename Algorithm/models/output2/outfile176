The bulk of this production is in Texas Louisiana and Oklahoma In the winter the US daily load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer the daily US load is less than 55 BCF Therefore storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas However these states produce more gas than they consume Most other states consume more gas than they produce Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking Very simplistic but maybe it helps
