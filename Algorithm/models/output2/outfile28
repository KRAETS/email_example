people to upgrade our master swap agreement database We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process Then once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees I ve developed two new databases we re currently working the kinks out of First is our jurisdictional database which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going I ve actually got the database designed we re working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon Of course the compelling project for us over the last 6 9 months has been online trading I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved and tie each product to a contract We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda legal advice etc This will be a cross product library financial physical power etc I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them So I ve got to create a lawyer user friendly index Among other documents this is I think where our forms might reside in addition all the research and advice on various legal issues we ve received from outside counsel as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world So the setup for this might go quickly although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem The last part we ve got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this

relay the following information to you don t kill me I m just the messenger With respect to your form of online GTC It need to be revised per Dave Forster by Monday to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non Australian based counterparty a counterparty could be U S Canadian European or other country based who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place and may or may not have credit in place to do a financial power transaction with Enron Australia In that regard I am attaching as a template our form of online Deemed ISDA GTC for a weather transaction the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation As you can see when you look at our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes such as authority and tax representations arm s length transaction reps acting as a principal rep the deletion of section 2 c ii of the ISDA Schedule netting in respect of the same transaction no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it your deletion of language re written confirmations definition of Transaction meaning the GTC ISDA form website terms Website uppercased is a defined term under the Password Application we usually say Loss instead of Market Quotation also Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6 e a question do we need the word integrated with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a single agreement to fall under the U S bankruptcy swap protection no ducment conflict provisions missing our severability and setoff language no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions business day defined as Sydney only etc Of course you do not have these in your form of GTC because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear

listing of any amendment to the Password Application ETA GTC or any other online documentation The information for the financial products is pretty accurate I may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel spreadsheets If I have missed a counterparty let me know The information for Power has been updated only since this database was in production about 6 7 weeks ago I am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists As for gas trading and emerging products we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with so no information has been entered for those products You should count them as being approved for everything Eventually if we continue not to use those dropdowns I will delete them I don t know if you will find this information helpful or not take a look and I will be glad to hear any input Obviously we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful
