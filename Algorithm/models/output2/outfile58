we receive every type of weather One day we could get 12 inches of snow the next day it could be 80 I have a pass to Keystone Breckenridge Vail Beaver Creek and A Basin My pass does not include Winter Park although I have a free lift ticket that I could use and go skiing with you My pass cost 300 and I get unlimited use I have been 23 times this year I think I got my money worth I do not know where Silvercreek is but I will look Do you mean Silverthorne by chance If there is any way to go to Keystone it would save Tracie and I some money But I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to Winter Park let me know and price is no concern This is how I rank the resorts as far as skiing 1 Vail 2 Copper 3 Keystone 4 Winter Park Mary Jane 5 Breckenridge I have not been to Beaver Creek but I heard that it was awesome Even though I ranked WP fourth it is still a great resort The runs at Keystone and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA 5300 acres compared to 2000 for Keystone As far as atmosphere night life Vail is by far the best Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night life that I recall but I have not been there much You have to go into town which is small Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is Copper but Vail is the best I love Vail if you have not noticed Just let me know as far as plans We have a busy March On March 17 the day you leave we have a wedding On Friday night we might have to go to the rehearsal dinner but I do not know yet Michelle and the kids are coming up in March also Maybe she can come up at the same time We always have a room available I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi Let me know if you guys want to do anything in Denver You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as well If you guys need any ski gear or accessories let me know and I will check here for prices Plus you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can t meet up with you You guys are going to love it here You also need to come out in the summertime It is so much better I think my sisters and dad are coming out again for the 4th of July We went white water rafting last year and Kim loved it Looking forward

ENRON on 02 21 2001 11 42 AM To James Simpson HOU ECT ECT Kevin Radous cc Gregg Penman Darron C Giron HOU ECT ECT Mark Mixon Kay Classen NA Enron Enron Lee Fascetti Paul Burgener hermannt pecorp com Subject OneOK storage deal Enovate sold a virtual storage service to OneOk marketing Transaction parameters MSV 500 000 mmbtu Daily injection withdraw rights 0 25 000 enovate s demand charge 1 75 per MSV mmbtu Commodity charges none Term Apr01 Mar02 Location People s Citygate As we all know our risk managment systems will not handle this kind of a transaction without al ot of manual manipulation Below are my recommendations for booking this transaction 1 enovate should book the expected usage pattern based on the current market curve with a zero price and hedge if the trader wants in enovate s MTM risk books The trader should periodically adjust this usage pattern as market conditions change The negative fallout from this expected usage should be applied against the demand charge 2 As Oneok actually withdraws or injects gas into the virtual storage we should record the transaction in Sitara and adjust our expected usage deal The trader can hedge this position financially physically or may be able to use the PGL Hub 3 The demand charge should be booked in Tagg Sitara and offset with financial annuity so we will not realize any MTM gain on the demand charge We will adjust this financial annuity as losses are incurred Once the annuity is all used up we will take all losses as incurred Any annuity amount left over at completion of the program will be taken as a gain at that time 4 This deal will be managed in the EMW book eventhough the actual injections withdraws will be recorded in the enovate book The enovate physcial book will be flat in and out at a zero price Cost of Carry should work in our favor unless they elect to go negative early All cash requirement should fall out in our EMW books Jim will build a model to determine the expected usage and track his related hedges This will be similar to what Lee has but not as complicated This is not intended to be a comprehensive description of how to book this transaction only an outline what I believe should be reflected in our books Please forward any questions or comments to me Thanks Richard

heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week the football Gods are smiling on you big time But regardless you ve got to admire Stoops and the job he has done They have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country And as far as the Horns are concerned I still think they are just an above average team They have beaten no one of any and I mean any significance They were completely outclassed against the one albeit right now the best team in the country good team they have played And lost to a bad Stanford team But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a T 1 win But right now I think the Aggies have a better team But if they start thinking

at some point you actually have to coach I lay this all at his feet Obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well I really don t know what to expect for the remainder of the season They obviously are not as bad as they showed on Saturday But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any Saturday and I really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated I was very wrong Something has to change The fact is they are 3 5 in the last 8 games And were favored in all but one Lack of talent is no longer an excuse I think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this Saturday If they play as poorly as they have all season they have beaten 3 terrible teams and lost to a bad one against Colorado they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6 5 and even 5 6 not out of the question For this reason I think that this could be the biggest game of Brown s tenure at UT What do you think
