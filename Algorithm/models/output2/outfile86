I am glad you sent me this message It will help to clarify a few issues 1 I was contacted by Christian this means I did not start this phase of the process last Friday as far as I can remember Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group I told him two things a We would be delighted to have him here b Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives your blessing before we can move ahead We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning your time with you Christian and Mike Roberts 2 Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian Mike and I decided to call you anyway Thu morning your time directly to discuss the matter I was in a PRC all afternoon and asked Mike to call you in case I could not sneak out to join him Mike called and was told you were out sick 3 I am leaving in a few hours for California I shall be driving back to Houston for the next 3 days Please feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with him in my absence 4 I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group assuming he moves to Houston I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July I did not bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here I can understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account But the first issue is if he can leave Sydney at all I hope it helps
