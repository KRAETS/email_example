this pathed if necessary Someone just needs to let me know Unresolved appears to be unassigned We no longer do business on Enron Field Services Lavaca Expense Transport This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for ENA ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1 Unresolved We should have a sale to Entex The deal will be enrtered in Sitara MidCon Texas Pipeline There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 and Dec I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to As it stands it looks like we have a long position Who is this assigned to I thought Carlos was handling this one but I could be wrong Unresolved We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara Channel Industries Pipeline Several issues here 1 All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left unpathed for Jan 1 I viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately Someone needs to review for accuracy Also there were deals that went to zero that were nominated for January Resolved but needs to be verified 2 We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement This issue has been left unsresolved since October 99 Volume Management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated Unresolved or Unpathed Carlos is looking into this 3 There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts Rec Mtr 1 6366 10 000 to Del Mtr 2 6203 10 000 This is a pathed pipeline We have no rate We need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for

Elsa HPL Operational This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December and January 1 Who is this assigned to This can wait until we get back next week If it is left unresolved I will get it
