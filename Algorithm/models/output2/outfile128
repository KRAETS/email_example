with you when you called the other day but things have been extremely busy around here and plus there is very little room for privacy In answer to your question there are no special requirements Back in the day they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience but anymore the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low that they will consider most people with an analytical or coordinative type background I think it s one of those things that once you get your foot in the door you can move on from there Just be aware that if you were to become a gas scheduler it may require working on weekends and late nights from time to time As far as the next step I would suggest that you just simply send an e mail to George Smith Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk and ask him if he has time to visit with you I think that by simply expressing an interest and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler and also learning what you can expect to learn from him should serve as the first step Also if he is interested and does not have a position currently open then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers They re actually pretty good about that I ll mention to George that you may give him a call Let me know if you have any further questions or want to visit some more Take care ","received_time":"2000-09-20

pain and discomfort when most times there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your breakthrough on the radio I told her if only the audience knew what you were talking about I still haven t had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation I called yesterday afternoon around 4 30 and

weighted average price of 16 00 for activity for December 22 26 2000 The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 15 76 but coupled with the volume not transacted online this price was estimated to be a 16 00 midpoint Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone Nicor Gas Company 18 16 20 000 Via ANR Hampshire Altrade GDD 05 10 000 NGPL Nicor WPS GDD 5 000 NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company 12 00 20 000 NGPL Nicor PG E 14 00 9 000 NGPL Nicor Kaztex 18 16 4 000 NBPL Nicor The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th As a result volumes were traded for the December 22 26 time period Gas Daily published a price of 15 70 for the December 22 26 time period Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23 26 time period I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd While my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online from time to time the there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price My volume is a little over stated but simply from a cursory glance standpoint as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information ","received_time":"2001-01-09
