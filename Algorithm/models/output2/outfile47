for the valid reasons she articulated but because I think we may have a conflict of interest here You see Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding As such we are currently involved albeit indirectly in negotiations with SoCal and other parties regarding the ability and mechanism for SoCal to recover costs to implement unbundled services on their system System pooling is one of those services I ll defer to counsel on this but in my humble opinion I don t think it wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on First its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give another party information that could prove to be prejudicial Secondly and probably more practically if Transwestern were of a mind to it could intentionally skew the

the record I have read Judge Biren s ruling and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on Friday it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments The three sentence e mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the PHC at which time she will rule on the motion and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the PHC I think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the PHC Jeffery Fawcett 04 07 2000 05 28 PM To Steven Harris ET S Enron ENRON Kevin Hyatt ET S Enron Enron Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Jeff Dasovich SFO EES EES mbaldwin igservice com Tim Aron ET S Enron ENRON Julia White ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject SoCal GIR settlement telecon I participated in a teleconference today at 3 00 p m with several members of the all party settlement group The ALJ assigned to the GIR case Andrea Biren has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal s Motion to Extend the deadline for filing the all party settlement Although I personally haven t seen the document yet it was the primary focus of the meeting According to accounts from the group Judge Biren s ruling did not grant SoCal s motion for extension Rather she will hear arguments on the motion during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday April 11 Judge Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the Commission Unfortunately she is silent on what date the testimony would be due originally testimony was due on April 17 In addition Judge Biren s ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into something different during Tuesday s prehearing conference ie a different procedural schedule or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol The telecon group decided to do the following 1 approach CPUC commissioner Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all party settlement and ask him to intervene in favor of the extension 2 go before Judge Biren on Tuesday as a group and individually if necessary and request that in leiu of a full scale testimony procedure would she accept a process whereby similar to what was done in the PG E settlement parties file declarations in favor of one settlement versus another and then the Judge supervises conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the settlement If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process one which arguably doesn t offer as complete a record in the case which most on the call felt was the likely outcome then would she agree to a schedule whereby she grants the SoCal motion the all party settlement is filed on April 17 then all parties including the Norm Pedersen group would have the chance to file testimony only testimony not additional declarations indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons logic including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives on or before May 5 As far as the all party settlement document is concerned SoCal will be forwarding a preliminary as yet incomplete draft for the parties to review but not to comment on SoCal intends to circulate another more complete version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments changes As far as Transwestern is concerned I ve spoken independently with the team Susan Mark and Jeff Dasovich Each of us will review and provide TW comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document Susan will be representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday Mark Baldwin will be there also to support Susan s efforts on Tuesday Susan and Jeff and maybe Mark will

path alt point will be unable to re nominate to its primary point once this alternate capacity I assume they mean USGT s is confirmed According to SoCal this will substantially limit shippers flexibility including the ability to use market area pooling Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al delivery regardless of the rights of the

Thanks DF From Susan Scott 04 25 2000 10 05 AM To Drew Fossum ENRON cc Subject contract issue Drew I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant Mark Baldwin of IGS Our consulting agreement with IGS which has now terminated provided for a flat fee plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract identified by IGS and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement During the term of the agreement TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern Southern was also on Lorraine s list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity Also the capacity was posted for all to see So while Mark can certainly claim he identified the deal he was not alone in doing so Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant On the other hand I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee However since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee this position is not as strong as I d like it to be and IGS might sue TW The amount in dispute could be as much as 200 000 depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS let me know I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal just in case they do decide to take us to court ","message_subject":"Re: contract issue","sent_time":"2000-05-01 06:39:00-07:00"},{"received_time":"2000-05-01

Panel Practice Cross Sessions in SFO for GIR I have scheduled two days of panel practice cross examination for those testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR NGS proceeding The first scheduled for May 24 will be held in the Sutter Room A B of the Hilton Hotel on O Farrell in SFO The session is scheduled to go from 9 00AM to 5 00PM Lunch will be brought in On May 25 we will meet in the same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for 10 00AM at the Commission s offices This practice cross session will start no later than 12Noon and go to 4 00PM Lunch will also be available I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most efficiently As of today we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony Given that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters I d like to suggest we bifurcate the sessions devoting May 24 from the hours of 9 00AM 2 00PM to capacity issues and 2 00PM 5 00PM to the retail panel On the 25th we would go from 12Noon 2 30PM on capacity and 2 30 4 00PM on retail matters I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective witnesses prior to the panel hearings We should concentrate on nailing down the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions After reviewing the draft testimony s over the last few days I think we are going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission s most promising options

conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called for now let s say a total Limited Day without notifying shippers of any percentages no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage and the rest could be scheduled IT Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me As currently configured TW s system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled Similarly if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day say 50 and 60 of the capacity in fact became available TW s system today would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60 not limit them to 50 TW s tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported Our question was whether by changing TW s LFT system as described in the first paragraph we wouldn t be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate If so is the change necessary for some other reason Please let me know what you think SS

need to make this clear on first reading looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional Don t we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding Page 2 you state that individual bid transactions are kept confidential What is confidential the identity of the shipper the bid itself In TW s IOS we post the individual bids as they come in but do not post the name of the shipper We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time I notice you call them sealed bids on page 4 not true if we re going to show them Page 3 why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding Especially since we plan to attract brand new shippers by offering this service Our credit dept folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day If we re asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places our example should be to 3 decimal places e g 0 351 Page 7 an Capacity Trading Agreement should be a Capacity Trading Agreement Page 8 So we don t appear low tech let s go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future Also we ve never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each bid A shipper may bid and re bid several times over the bidding process They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of or prior to the first bid I

awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal here is my 2 cents worth The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW s tariff for some reason that s never been clear to me See Section 13 A Sheet No 18 All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline See Section 13 D but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process not to an open season for other capacity Even if the one month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids Tony am I right about this The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions beginning on Sheet No 72 TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically I ve found nothing in else in TW s tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other I believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we ve proposed to do Hope this helps If you want to discuss this I ll be

and FTS 3 in same bucket I m leaning towards not changing since the language is already general enough to cover us there The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in the last cycle I do not believe any changes are necessary there either The tariff language as it s currently written says we shall issue an OFO and we would but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets 27A and 68A or if there are any other issues we need to

several hours of on line research on this last Sept turned up nothing on point The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I ll excerpt here In Maritimes Northeast Pipeline L L C 80 FERC P 61 346 1997 Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted Commission staff denied the blanket request but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut off dates FN29 in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive On the other hand Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public Generally the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities FN30 However in the instance case the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and thus evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services Therefore we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut off dates to be made public FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events FN30 See e g Colorado Interstate Gas Company 76 FERC P 61 291 1996 In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America 82 FERC P 61 037 1998 which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements In ANR Pipeline Co the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power Even where transportation competition exists that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases Just to make sure I found everything I ll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything From Drew Fossum 02

as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than Dec Jan Feb July and Aug Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as maintenance I m not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned as the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time I am also not completely comfortable calling this force majeure because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party however since the definition does include binding order of any court or governmental authority we could possibly say this is force majeure if we re reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety rule In that event our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure notice If not we can argue that since this is not maintenance but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner the shippers rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions In that case damages if any would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer however the outage is going to be relatively short and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction I recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure

I ve been studying the El Paso Dynegy reservation reduction mechanism RRM Basically the deal was that Dynegy s minimum pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso s transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold The parties based the threshold on El Paso s monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9 30 97 The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy s monthly reservation charge to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month This provision of course met with heavy opposition however FERC allowed it FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT it was not unduly discriminatory The unduly discriminatory conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal gas transportation market the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept it That s my 2 cents worth on this particular issue I ll come down around 3 30 to chat with you more about the Duke I have a

Broadcasting System and numerous other creative and performing arts If NEA is lost or weakened our lives will be similarly diminished In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and streamline their services some government officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile Currently taxes from the general public for PBS equal 1 12 per person per year and the National Endowment for the Arts equals 64 a year A January 1995 CNN USA Today Gallup poll indicated that 76 of Americans wish to keep funding for PBS third only to national defense and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding Each year the Senate and House Appropriations Committees each have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill The goal each year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the

harm If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life There are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical not because they were born that way but because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face I don t mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day to day mind set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character The smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most so always be observant This includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect To that end I have one last comment I am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile

of the Gallup Expansion Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf d to Topock Once the Gallup expansion is built Transwestern will have a total of 290 MMcf d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point 40 MMcf d more than PG E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern s potential liability to shippers would be if PG E s refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG E Topock The legal answer is that Transwestern s tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper More specifically Rate Schedule FTS 1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper In December January February July and August the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered In all other months the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75 of nominated confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern s failure to provide service under an FTS 1 contract A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge including for example the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper s inability to fulfill contractual obligations Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages Can we meet briefly to discuss this I m available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a m or after lunch on Friday or we can discuss a meeting time for next week Thank you ","message_subject":"Confidential: PG&E/Topock

Here s a brief answer to your questions With regard to segmentation Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity so we would have considerable leeway here The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate or primary points Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions including our current restriction on changing primary points that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW On hourly service I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without running afoul of the Peak and Off Peak Rates i e seasonal rates provisions of the order In other words I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service As for how to communicate with our customers I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion I realize the order becomes effective March 27 however compliance filings are not due until May 1 and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1 Before the beginning of April the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well organized presentation to persons outside the company The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available In the meantime if your customers have questions I ll be happy to help answer them Christine Stokes 03 02 2000 10 32 AM To Susan Scott ET

Summary Items Thanks Susan for the 637 summary Here are a couple of items that I need additional clarification on 1 Segmentation You summarized Pipelines must allow segmentation to the extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff provisions Does this mean for example an Ignacio to California contract i e 40 000 Dth d at a 20 total path rate could be segmented by the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM d from Ignacio to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM d from Blanco to California If they could would the 20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 MM d 20 for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or would they only pay the 20 applied to the contract s 40 MM d MDQ Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this segmented basis but unless the discount letter providing the 20 specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths if these paths are not already provided as alternate receipt or delivery paths 2 Peak OFF Peak Rates You summarized The policy does not apply to long term

2000 04 39 PM To Drew Fossum ET S Enron ENRON cc Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Subject Re Gas Sales on TW FYI a little more background The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW s efforts to unbundle under Order No 636 whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas In addition we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as well as our de minimus sales function All Amgas does today is administer our sales function We never eliminated our sales function we just transferred the administration of it to Amgas The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline s sales division be treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate Our standards of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in any of the day to day operations of Transwestern s merchant function As a result the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G FTS 2 transportation service is the unbundled no notice transportation service the former and current sales customers received under Order No 636 I think we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function is even smaller than it was when we unbundled true which is not enough work for an agent to perform and that we ve brought it back in house and explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared operating employee under G Maria From Drew Fossum 03 06 2000 11 02 AM To Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Maria Pavlou ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject Re Gas Sales on TW This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC If we can save the 60 000 yr it would be worth asking FERC for authority to simply use an ET S market services person to administer the farm tap sales from time to time without any functional separation or other junk We could even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable that we are not going to expand the business The NN situation was different I think because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use of its sales rate schedule Would TW use the FTS 2 rate schedule We have never formally discontinued the TW sales function right What do you guys think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver Has it ever approved similar small volume waivers DF From Susan Scott 03 02 2000 04 32 PM To Drew Fossum ENRON Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron ENRON Dari Dornan Enron cc Subject Gas Sales on TW I ve been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas TW no longer has any gas purchase contracts just a handful of sales contracts to persons who granted rights of way to TW Many of these parties don t even buy gas on a regular basis but they still have the contractual right to do so We pay AmGas around 60 000 year to administer the contracts The AmGas contract is terminable on 30 days notice I know that last year NNG re established its pipeline sales division to make occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons i e the base gas deal Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same Looks like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved but would like to hear from you what all was involved behind the scenes in other words was it as easy as it looked Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to waive the Section 284 286 requirements in this instance since the remaining sales contracts are so few and insignificant

regard to the Commission s limitations on the right of first refusal Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long term contracts that are now subject to ROFR The Commission s rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re execute current contracts The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts In limiting the right of first refusal the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract In light of these conclusions there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline s tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an as amended basis Consistent with the Commission s order it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract

capacity I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity thus there is no cost shift potential to other shippers Net costs will be separately recorded 2 Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the no tying part 3 Would TW s marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity 4 Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM s customers to the detriment of PNM s customers No PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal Service contract under PNM s tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW 5 How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW s existing open access operations TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM s line from Blanco NM i e the Blanco Hub operated by TW to Rio Puerco NM where PNM s system interconnects with TW s mainline Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW s tariff The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW s FTS 1 LFT and ITS right rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW s system Lorraine we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM Would we be able to acquire on an as needed basis Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff Which would come first our deal with PNM or with our shipper It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios 6 Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities Yes Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system It would enable TW to transport an additional of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW s system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW s system at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently ","message_subject":"Acquisition of PNM capacity","sent_time":"2000-03-08

a discounted rate for each of the one day terms for a certain period of time typically one month Steve Harris wants to be able to sell daily firm for a one year period In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one day terms as usual and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year I see no problem with this do you Apparently the
