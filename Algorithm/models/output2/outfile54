Merger we had commented that instaed of the materially weaker standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated below BBB by S P Do you feel strongly about this Alos we usually have language

year valued at 98 6 In the CSA if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with a party s request either for the transfer or return of collateral normally the following procedures apply a the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral request was made b the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request c the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time and if a resolution is not reached a recalculation of the Exposure is made and market quotations have to be obtained We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute notice is given DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the dispute on their own What do you think 7 If a party holds

threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this Alos does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner 2 They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger 3 They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger Should we specify a threshold 4 They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers For example are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe and if not doesn t that trigger clause 2 of this additional Termination Event I don t think the cure language works and I don t understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger

Enclosed are drafts of i the ISDA schedule ii Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex and iii our standard guarantee Also included is a draft what should be in the L C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L C Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current issues would more easily be seen in the draft Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below Note our legal council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now and we can make further adjustments if any based on our legal department review next week 1 Part 1 e After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager Brant Reves they decided to make the cross default threshold at 100MM for each credit support provider 2 1 h Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will apply for 3 years or less Loss for over 3 years 3 5 g I am confused by this change I added back in the word obligations in para B 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning affiliates I m not sure my predecessor deleted them it is not deleted on my 3 20 00 draft but I can t imagine who else would Two comments i do you think this is best way to word this and 2 my legal council who is out most of this week will have to review your final wording before we can execute 4 5 l Changed the telephone recording paragraph by a not limiting it to just trading staff and b adding to the extent permitted by applicable law 5 5 n q All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement However these were not discussed in Susan s last memo to you except the adding back in of paragraph q so I am leaving them as is 6 Part 6 After reviewing your changes vs our standard paragraphs I have no objections to your changes 7 13 b i C Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even though we don t normally use Independent Amounts 8 13 b iii A Letters of Credit changes days to 20 from 10 per your request After re reading I don t understand how it improves the position of the secured party If the L C has an expiration date and the secured party attempts to execute i e cash in this L C then if the L C is within 20 days of its expiration the value can drop to zero Before the L C maintained 100 of its value until 10 days prior to expiration Since Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective how does your position improve based on this change 8 13 b iii B and C

comfortable that it establishes the authority of GPU Services Company to enter into power transactions on behalf of the utilities The Agreement provides in Section 3 that each Company will furnish to such other Company one or more of the Goods and that a ll Goods provided hereunder shall be priced at cost Thus the Agreement provides that the Service Company can buy power and sell it to a utility at cost It does not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of the utilities In the absence of such documentation I propose language to add to the Electronic Trading Agreement to address my concerns I would also like to have each of the utilities sign a short acknowledgment form acknowledging the authority of GPU Service Company to enter into transactions with EPMI on its behalf Attached below please find my proposed revisions to the Letter Agreement amending the ETA which was originally forwarded to you by Carol St Clair as well as the

Subject ISDA Tax Issue Rhett You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term Indemnifiable Tax Another counterparty Deutsche Bank has requested the following which I think is very similar to what we were looking at before Notwithstanding the foregoing IndemnifiableTax also means any Tax imposed by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer unless the payee is incorporated organized managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such jurisdiction or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or office located in such jurisdiction In the ISDA Users guide they explain that the effect of this language is to eliminate the payee s risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer s jurisdiction even if the payee s activities in such jurisdiction is the basis for such taxes except if the circumstances in the definition

things were a bit hectic I m officially brain dead today so I thought that I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people Things on the baby front are progressing well On our last ultrasound we got the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so I ve got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am still taking it easy and swimming alot The baby weighed about 4 pounds a few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved Now I m trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready the people here at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will help since other than some of Arthur s clothes I am starting from scratch Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few weeks I m hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time off but we will see how that goes I really feel great except for being uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is good practice for when the baby comes Arthur is doing great We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger pet They re pretty cute small clean and so far easy to maintain He is still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All star team which we were absolutely thrilled about as was he He called dad practically every day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I m hoping that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend Arthur would be on cloud nine if he came We ll see Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a week over the summer and we are looking into that I m toying with the possibility of sending him when the baby is born but I ll just have to see how it works out I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby is born Do you have any thoughts on that You are obvious y welcome at any time but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in august Let me know what you think How is Cindy doing Do you know what she needs for her new addition Do you want to get her a joint gift Let me know I m happy to do either something on my own or jointly with you How s

into with them Specifically the CA does the following calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount Fixed Amount or Cash Settlement Amount payable gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred Also my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty cap to 25 000 000 from 15 000 000 Is that okay with you They had initially requested no cap On Reliant Energy Services Inc you were going to think about the following credit issues 1 Specified Transaction they want to include physical energy deals You were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap They wanted to amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this but I think you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified Transaction 2 Cross Default threshold is 3 of equity okay 3 On Credit Event Upon Merger they want to define materially weaker as either 1 being below investment grade by either S P or Moody s or 2 being failed to be rated by either S P or Moody s 4 On setoff they did not have the affiliate language 5 In the CSA they want the collateral that is posted to secure both financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and Reliant Energy Services Inc 6 In the collateral threshold they have proposed a matrix of S P and Moody s ratings with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings AA Aa3 and above 20 000 000 A A3 to A A1 15 000 000 BBB Baa2 to BBB Baa1 10 000 000 BBB Baa3 5 000 000 Also they have defined MAC to be going below BBB by S P or below Baa3 by Moody s or a failure to be rated by either S P or Moody s 7 In the LC provisions they have different cure periods for each of the types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur Here is a summary of the events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral If issuer s credit rating is downgraded 1 business Day after written demand by the Secured Party if issuer fails to
