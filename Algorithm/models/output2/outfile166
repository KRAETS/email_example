Management a nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem ent can not be trusted Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior Management started believing the end justifies the means The communicati on the Employee s have received over the last few years about values such a s Respect Integrity Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten ded to get Employee s to believe Senior Management really supported these v alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som ething just the opposite I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in the future Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t he statement It s just a balance sheet issue implies to me that this ind ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa inly should not be speaking to the public If you are going to play the ga me of lying cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen t a plausible story To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua ting values in some of Enron s broadband telecommunications and other techn ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini tion of the word HEDGE A hedge by definition implies that the upside an d downside exposure has been limited It frightens me that we are out aski ng customers to let Enron help them HEDGE their risk when I m not sure En ron s Senior Management understands what a hedge means I m also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i n the investment vehicle that generated this write down I must be confuse d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the Natural Gas Business This must be an example of as my father used to say do as I say not as I do I guess we need to have audits performed of Se nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as their word The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin ion is CRIMINAL It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months These individuals have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity They are set for life h aving all the money they could ever need while Employees and Stockholders have lost their life savings You have completely failed at the job you we re hired to perform If this type of activity would have occurred farther down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve d and to institute criminal charges 20 I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week I do not think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we trust what is said anyway Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee s a th orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities what actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor mance to date 20

to frustrate you more but I would like you to consider the following suggestions 1 It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central East and Texas Desk be so far apart Under the current limits the Central desk can have a position 2 000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1 000 Contracts larger 2 When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses VAR LIMITS DESK P L EAST 10 MILLION 66 1 MILLION CENTRAL 12 MILLION 13 9 MILLION TEXAS 8 MILLION 55 8 MILLION 3 It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom I There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated In fact in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR limit The P L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than 500 000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit For example if a desks VAR limit is 10 000 000 and the VAR is 12 000 000 the P L for the desk would be decreased by 2 000 000 If the situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed This method I believe makes for an even playing field Under the current procedures what I m learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance Thanks
