09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly the new c ompressors at Stations 1 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service within the one year deadline in the FERC order The removal of the existin g units at those stations however will not be completed until six months after that My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o ut of service by the one year deadline and are no longer operational we sh ould be ok and don t need to ask FERC for an extension The ordering paragr aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi ce within one year from the date of the order It does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities I take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time i e c ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we ve installed and place d into operation the new compressors since this would result in TW operat ing compression in excess of
