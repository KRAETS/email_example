is that PCB s have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx 160 miles from the Topock C S PG E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6 1 00 Now for the bad news At the conclusion of the meeting PG E has stated that they want their Topock C S decontaminated This includes all piping and equipment I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB s from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system Additionally the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations Even with this they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned Preliminary estimates range to approx 3 5 million I think that this is only the tip of the iceberg If they are successful with this action the pipeline system will be next Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe valves etc Ill keep you informed on this

by managing liquids not deconing Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal Transwestern s proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage their PCBs Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB s and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred Michel Nelson 03 28 2000 09 18 AM To Larry Campbell ET S Enron Enron cc Louis Soldano ET S Enron Enron Rick Craig OTS Enron ENRON

service is on schedule There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system PG E is also on schedule for June 5 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon tank at the separator installation site This is a PG E issue and will not create a delay of the in service date All other permits and approvals according to PG E are in place PG E has stated that after operation of the separators they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ET S Post construction of the separators will result in 2 50 ft joints of 34 in pipe PG E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PG E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PG E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe 2 Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP 353 kettleman C S latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley C S Line 311 is a 12 in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed 22 ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG E s biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB s Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of 1 3 ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free 3 Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PG E system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PG E to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PG E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks 4 Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter Separators Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority 1 sites The determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria 1 a location where liquids were collected twice and 2 ppm concentration of the liquids collected was 1 0 ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is 300 500 mmscf day Samples collected at this location have shown PCB s in the range of 1 4 ppm PG E s agreement with SoCal at this location is 1 0 ppm PCB s in the liquid phase PG E has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PG E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PG E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCB s at their interconnect locations 5 Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter Separators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PG E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for 16 sites with back up to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of 45 filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume F S up to the 29 indicated at the last meeting is 1 2 to 1 3 million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PG E presented One PG E customer a cement plant has inquired about PG E deconning portions of their plant that has PCB s PG E is in discussions with the cement company PG E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a 2001 project 6 Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PG E C S to study lube oil systems There are 22 compressors at the Topock and Hinkley C S s Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle 7 Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January 2000 rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PG E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250 300 mmscf day cap by May 15 Over time PG E will look into their C S configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf day 8 Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in 45 days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as some of the PG E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on other business

I called Ms Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues 1 Ms Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division which is lead by a fellow named Mr Rizvi Mr Rizvi had contacted Ms Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the next semiannual sampling event This event is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 19th I am to notify Ms Bernacik when we have set a firm date for sampling 2 Ms Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off site access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional wells I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had picked it up but I wasn t certain I followed up with Norm and he has picked up the permit Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th 3 I asked Ms Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST removal Ms Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue Ms Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr Moreno s letter At a minimum the Pueblo will require continued monitoring This does not change our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program However Ms Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two additional monitor wells in the former UST area 4 I asked Ms Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area Ms Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW s request to close the landfarm I asked again about backfilling the excavation but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the excavation rather than closure of the landfarm I reviewed the letter from Ms Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically address backfilling the excavation I believe that Ms Bernacik is under the impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation if we still want to get this in writing it may be best for Norm to visit with Ms Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need "}]}
