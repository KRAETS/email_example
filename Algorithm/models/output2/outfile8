sad time for all of you and it sounds like you don t really need that right now If you visit us we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me Plus Cameron acts like a 2 year old which is a delight He started at a new school a few weeks ago The Post Oak School a Montessori school about a block from our house and he is really coming into his own It is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born Little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events don t even get me started on

We haven t been to Houston in a long time and are due for a visit We almost came the weekend of Feb 5 6 because a group was getting together to go to Jay s gravesite in honor of his Feb 10th birthday But work kept me here that weekend Hopefully sometime soon I can get over there and see you Trey Cameron Any plans to come this way I d love to see you For V Day we went out to eat at the Hula Hut I picked up my brother Ed from the airport he had been in Santa Fe with Joe for a long weekend we are taking turns and Ed came with us for our nice romantic dinner Later Rog and I went for coffee and dessert as a special treat We still have a great time together just talking about stuff and catching up on the day s happenings Hope all is going well with the investigation it sounded like you were

questions about birthplace citizenship personal travel and reason for return from prior assignment The questions about birthplace citizenship are the most risky As I have discussed with others such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination particularly if one s birthplace country is not evident from any other source It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job related and consistent with business necessity What is the purpose of this inquiry Are we trying to determine whether a person is eligible to work in a particular country If so it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need We already have a field on where a person is eligible to work which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country but is on a work visa to another Any other information may not be necessary The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don t want to keep on a system For example if a person left because of health reasons or the birth of a child it really is not a job related issue What is the purpose of this question Is there a less intrusive way to ask it Finally the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job related What is the purpose of that inquiry Is there another way to gather that information Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above If you would like to discuss this further please give me a call

because there are certain exceptions to the salary basis test for example licensed attorneys do not have to meet that test it depends on what the employees are doing as to whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue If they do not fit within one of the exceptions we probably should have them affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the overtime rate You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the overtime rate If they are not working over 40 hours in a week it will not be an issue Let me know if you have questions Michelle Felecia Acevedo ENRON 04 27 2000 05 40 PM To Michelle

exempt employees and their pay is calculated on an hourly rate Unless I understand the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt employees on an hourly basis If they are reduced hours we would need to determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees An exempt employee should only be tracking exception time i e sick vacation etc any off duty time but not work hours during the day An exempt worker according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis not on an hourly basis If I am off base let me know otherwise I would like your help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees

participated in a lunch yesterday on Capitol Hill which discussed the recently concluded bilateral negotiations between Europe and the US on the issue of data privacy safe harbor I admit that I don t fully understand the issue but in essence I m told it s an internal EU directive passed a few years ago not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet by the way that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of the privacy of transmitted data eg over the internet The EU wants to forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don t adequately protect the information As always the EU wants to regulate the issue while the US prefers self regulation After two years of negotations they agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be put in safe harbors which are basically approved bodies that would check the recipient s ability to protect the privacy of the information ie an American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or offices How does this affect Enron A couple of other company reps said it is especially pertinent to HR issues such as transmitting personnel information salary etc from Europe back to the home office in the US Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe does this affect us and do you want us to track down more information Regards Steve Burns
