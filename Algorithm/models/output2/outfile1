not be able to offer adequate size on the options Optimally I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes If the swap is 4 4 5 one a day up and someone buys half a day making the market 4 4 5 one a day by half a day the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts a much smaller size than most people want to trade If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4 4 5 one a day by half a day the input into the option calculator is 3 75 4 75 100 up In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest we must continue to support it Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves In terms of straddle strikes I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off Although striking on the mid market is probably easier for the trader I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200 they have to call ENE to close the trade If the trade is struck at 3100 we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times Secondly I would anticipate non volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market
