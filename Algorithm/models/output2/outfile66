ie Resources I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix with you Additional discretionay items to consider are overheads perhaps AFUDC and perhaps indirect allocations ie corporate allocations There is more than capital and o m to consider when developing a comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the cash flows and their timing both in savings and out and not worry about accounting From an accounting standpoint and if an ORR is necessary its important to identify the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow Components may include Initial Capital Ongoing Capital Overheads and AFUDC if applied Net O M direct and indirect Book

since Steve is out this week I don t think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs using an Enron Risk System We did more research and got the other groups involved so that they would understand our decision I believe everyone is now comfortable with our purchase decision In our analysis of systems we selected the Caminus product in part because we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen Deliotte Touche and Ernst Young These organizations especially Arthur Andersen have audited this application and have actually participated in numerous implementations Ernst Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable Resources Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 6 other companies and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for Tractabel After talking with individuals from these accounting firms we felt very confident that the product was sound and we should not have audit concerns Obviously we have a lot of business procedures that have to be established and there is time in the work plan to do that work but a lot of those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes Regarding costs we have an approved work order for 650 000 which covers all the initial hardware software implementation costs and first year maintenance This cost does represent a very limited implementation with only 10 concurrent users no customization except a few reports and no electronic interfaces or data conversion The assumption is that initially the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost justified and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as well The on going costs are estimated at approximately 100 000 year We did not perform a separate cost benefit analysis as this was in the original cost of the Revenue Management RAROC Let me know if you have any other questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to completing

one situation in the past NPNG had the contract for maintaining a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND in fact Phil may have been involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow In
