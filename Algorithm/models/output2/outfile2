Champ Road Test Careers in Sports ESPN Classic SportsFigures Sports JEOPARDY Training Room Vid Game Reviews Tuesday May 30 Mock draft No 1 Mihm s the word By Andy Katz ESPN com With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere between few and none this year s selections will be based on the potential of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams NBA scouts general managers and player personnel directors are banking heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre draft camp June 6 9 Because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily this is the first of several projections we ll have on ESPN com A number of players still have work to do to earn first round spots but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and or a strong showing in Chicago The borderline first rounders who didn t make ESPN com s list but have a chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush LSU senior center Jabari Smith Temple junior guard Mark Karcher UCLA freshman guard Jason Kapono Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal Connecticut junior point guard Khalid El Amin Indiana senior guard A J Guyton Ohio State senior point guard Scoonie Penn Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock Ohio State junior guard Michael Redd Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens Turkey forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must decide if it s worth the risk to stay in the draft Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school Rush El Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft regardless of what happens ESPN com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22 Chris Mihm Mihm towered over much of the competition in college 1 New Jersey Chris Mihm 7 0 Jr Texas The Nets need a center and could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin but the pick here is Mihm The Nets could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next season or deal it to the Bulls for the No 4 and No 7 picks 2 Vancouver Kenyon Martin 6 9 Sr Cincinnati The Grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No 2 He s the hardest working player in the draft and with a healthy leg the most effective low post scorer Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur Rahim and Bryant Reeves If the Grizzlies aren t ready to go with Martin he makes for a tantalizing trade 3 Los Angeles Clippers Stromile Swift 6 9 So LSU The Clippers have already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small power forward which goes against LSU coach John Brady s philosophy of how to use him defensively But if Swift knows he s going to the Clips he could opt to return to school He has said he will not hire an agent leaving the door open for a return 4 Chicago Joel Przybilla 7 0 Soph Minnesota The Bulls need a center for their triangle offense If they can t trade for Mihm Przybilla is next in line He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls championship runs 5 Orlando Marcus Fizer 6 8 Jr Iowa State The Magic love Darius Miles but won t let Fizer drop below No 5 if he s available Fizer gives the Magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic 6 Atlanta Mike Miller 6 8 Soph Florida The Hawks have been high on Miller for a month and won t let him slide past them Miles might be a better scorer but Miller s versatility will win the Hawks over at No 6 Atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard 7 Chicago Darius Miles 6 9 HS East St Louis Ill The Bulls can package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy McGrady Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for Miles to develop 8 Cleveland Iakovos Tsakalidis 7 1 Greece The Cavs want size and the third rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis The Celtics covet him too but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt Reviews on Tsakalidis are split either scouts love him or think he s too slow 9 Houston Courtney Alexander 6 5 Sr Fresno State Alexander could go higher but not above six The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce during individual workouts The choice of Alexander DeShawn Stevenson DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue Alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game 10 Orlando DeShawn Stevenson 6 5 HS Washington Union Fresno Calif The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks If Miles is gone Stevenson will be too by No 11 Orlando has scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season 11 Boston DerMarr Johnson 6 9 Fr Cincinnati Johnson can t slip past 11 with his Lamar Odom like skills on the wing The Celtics need size but can t let a scorer get past them in the draft Johnson learned defense from Max Good and Bob Huggins so Rick Pitino s pressure defense shouldn t be much different 12 Dallas Mamadou N diaye 7 0 Sr Auburn Trying to predict what Don Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft But the Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt They can t afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man N diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in Chicago if he shows 13 Orlando Mateen Cleaves 6 2 Sr Michigan State The Magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks but no one is good enough to spend the No 5 or No 10 pick on Cleaves is at the top of the point guard list list and would fit Rivers style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness 14 Detroit Morris Peterson 6 6 Sr Michigan State The Pistons won t let the local hero leave the state Peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency Peterson could go higher if he s gone the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson 15 Milwaukee Etan Thomas 6 9 Sr Syracuse The Bucks want a power forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin Fizer and Swift None will be available by the time they pick Thomas can give them a rebounder and defender something they lacked in their playoff losses to the Pacers 16 Sacramento Erick Barkley 6 1 Soph St John s The Kings need a backup point to Jason Williams Barkley could come in and wouldn t be under any pressure to perform immediately He s the No 2 point guard behind Cleaves 17 Seattle Quentin Richardson 6 6 Soph DePaul Had Richardson stayed he would have probably been in the lottery next season But he doesn t fit all of the teams needs above which is why he falls all the way to the Sonics He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis if he re signs 18 Los Angeles Clippers Keyon Dooling 6 3 Soph Missouri The Clippers need a point guard but won t take one at No 3 Dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don t carry into the draft But the potential of being a mid teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school 19 Charlotte Jerome Moiso 6 10 Soph UCLA Moiso could still slide up into the late lottery maybe to Dallas but if he falls the Hornets will catch him Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket The Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft 20 Philadelphia Jamal Crawford 6 6 Fr Michigan The Sixers have already called on Crawford s behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he s in the first round regardless of where he s being picked 21 Toronto Craig Speedy Claxton 5 11 Sr Hofstra The Raptors have already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five If Cleaves Barkley Dooling and Crawford are all gone Claxton is the natural pick for the Raptors 22 New York Jamaal Magloire 6 11 Sr Kentucky The Knicks took some heat for taking Frederic Weis last year Jeff Van Gundy wants tough physical players Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post 23 Utah Hanno M tt l 6 9 Sr Utah The Jazz can t go wrong with picking M tt l from nearby Utah He can score from the wing but he ll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward If M tt l doesn t go to the Jazz he could slip out of the first round 24 Chicago Jeryl Sasser 6 7 Jr SMU The Bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can t go after one in the lottery The most intriguing point guard left could be Sasser He can play both guard positions he s one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the Bulls some versatility on the floor 25 Phoenix Jason Collier 7 0 Sr Georgia Tech The Suns need another big guy to go with Luc Longley either as a backup or on the floor together Collier has more offensive potential than many big men The Suns have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center 26 Utah Chris Carrawell 6 6 Sr Duke The Jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State s Desmond Mason Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree He could still go higher but his tweener status fits more as a late first round pick 27 Indiana Donnell Harvey 6 8 Fr Florida Harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts and he didn t leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round The Pacers have a history of going younger in the draft 28 Portland Soumaila Samake 7 2 Cincinnati Stuff IBL The Blazers don t need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA Samake has the size shot blocking skills and potential to be an NBA center Arvydas Sabonis doesn t have many miles left in his legs 29 Los Angeles Lakers Desmond Mason 6 6 Sr Oklahoma State Here s where any one of the bubble players could go such as Rush Karcher or Stephens But Mason is a more polished experienced player He gives the Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN com ALSO SEE NBA draft order Nets weigh M M s Mihm and Martin Early entry

it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly accrual value can be determined This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately 275 000 of accrual value per month The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status accrual term deals actual volumes greater than booked half cent bid to mid spread incorrect markings and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs Of the above Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen accrual deals actual volumes greater than or less than booked and deals incorrectly marked Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs such as gas quality issues The breakout of

result of this segregation it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly accrual value can be determined This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately 275 000 of accrual value per month The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status accrual term deals actual volumes greater than booked half cent bid to mid spread incorrect markings and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs Of the above Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen accrual deals actual volumes greater than or less than booked and deals incorrectly marked Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs such as gas quality issues The breakout of this value has been on average 60 to Greg and 40 to Tom The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value January Total Accrual Value 266 504 Greg s Value Tom s Value
