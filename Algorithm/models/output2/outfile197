m sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue but I ve visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out what happened to this deal Basically Idaho got their

remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill which they did in a separate deal So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour ahead market Now the question is how do we confirm the deal From your side is it better if we leave the deal as is or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time

Symes Student No 569430668 1 The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes that is the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward This would result in an increase in price and a corresponding increase in supply As the supply curve comes up to meet the new higher demand curve we would actually see an increase in overall demand supply AND price The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price 2 a The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 bottles of soda b I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction c Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D This follows from the logic that when I have 100 bottles of soda it would take about 8 more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle Here I have 200 bottles of soda I would need AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use 3 Firstly this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes but because it would incent people to find other possibly more dangerous modes of transportation 4 Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit It also narrows consumers choice sets when buying a new car A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision In a country indoctrinated by Nader s book the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away all cars are made equally safe Because of this car buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons Soon safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely legislation has made cars in consumers minds indestructible If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them 5 a My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price just under 10 So when I purchase 5 gallons at 5 a gallon I am better of by 12 50 b I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at 3 a gallon than when it s priced at 5 Therefore I m better off by 2 50 a gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of 2 divided by 2 c If Diet Coke was free I d consume up to 10 gallons of it

appreciate having access to them by Tuesday Please let me know what steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process To the best of my knowledge we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones NP 15 or SP 15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry We also need to be assured that when these deals are settled the correct data will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones Thank you for your help and cooperation I will be in touch on Monday Kate Symes West Desk Deal Control 503 464 7486","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2001-01-12

last several weeks our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk have entered off peak deals by choosing the off selection under the Hours heading But the mask doesn t change to include Sundays and Holidays and the traders then enter another deal to compensate for this What we ve found then is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and Holidays round the clock hours My question is when you enter an off peak deal in Deal Blotter does it automatically read that as Mon through Sat off peak hours AND Sundays and Holidays round the clock Even though the mask does not change to show Sundays and Holidays I m just wondering if there is an easier way to assure that we ve entered off peak deals correctly other than double checking them in Deal Entry Please call or e mail when you get a chance Again this could be just a matter of incorrect settings in someone s blotter but I d like to make sure either way Thanks for your time

born American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone 1876 For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction with Alexander Melville Bell s Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in English Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training Alexander Graham was not added until he was 11 was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell Apart from one year at a private school two years at Edinburgh s Royal High School from which he was graduated at 14 and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London Bell was largely family trained and self taught His first professional post was at Mr Skinner s school in Elgin County Moray where he instructed the children in both music and elocution In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin s Weston House Academy where he conducted his first studies in sound Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life as a teacher scientist In 1868 he became his father s assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis which had also struck down his younger brother and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell Concern for their only surviving son prompted the family s move to Canada in August 1870 where after settling near Brantford Ont Bell s health rapidly improved In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father s Visible Speech published in 1866 as a means of teaching speech to the deaf Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips tongue and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way Young A Graham Bell as he now preferred to be known showed using his father s system that speech could be taught to the deaf His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture Even while vacationing at his parents home Bell continued his experiments with sound In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer and continued to study and tutor in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University Never adept with his hands Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson a young repair mechanic and model maker who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard two deaf students whom he helped were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits Nevertheless during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands It is scarcely surprising that Bell s health again suffered On April 6 1875 he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop while maintaining his daily professional schedule Bell had to return to his parents home in Canada to recuperate In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone On March 7 1876 the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number 174 465 covering The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds Within a year followed the commercial application and a few months later the first of hundreds of legal suits Ironically the telephone until then all too often regarded as a joke and its creator prophet as at best an eccentric was the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bell s Scottish integrity but the outcome of all the litigation which persisted throughout the life of his patents was that Bell s claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current In 1877 Bell married Mabel Hubbard 10 years his junior The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone indeed in many ways it was a beginning A resident of Washington D C Bell continued his experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophone transmission of sound on a beam of light in medical research and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize and the 50 000 francs roughly equivalent to U S 10 000 financed the Volta Laboratory where in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin Chichester A Bell Bell invented the Graphophone Employing an engraving stylus controllable speeds and wax cylinders and disks the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording Bell s share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf since 1956 the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf May 8 1893 was one of Bell s happiest days his 13 year old prodigy Helen Keller participated in the ground breaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau building today an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia There in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland he established a summer home Beinn Bhreagh complete with research laboratories In 1898 Bell succeeded his father in law as president of the National Geographic Society Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few Again he found the proper hands Gilbert Grosvenor his future son in law who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century he experimented with giant man carrying kites Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories Always an inspiration Mabel Hubbard Bell wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association the first research organization established and endowed by a woman Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell At Beinn Bhreagh Bell entered new subjects of investigation such as sonar detection solar distillation the tetrahedron as a structural unit and hydrofoil craft one of which weighed more than 10 000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per hour in 1919 Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf Bell never lingered on one project His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings often totally unrelated to the subject at hand reminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition indeed some undoubtedly have yet to be developed The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph 4 for the photophone 1 for the phonograph 5 for aerial vehicles 4 for hydroairplanes and 2 for a selenium cell Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal During his last dictation he was reassured with Don t hurry to which he replied I have to ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-11-01 03:00:00-08:00","sent_time":"2000-11-01 03:00:00-08:00","email_attachment":null,"message_subject":"Phone

I m right there with ya sister As far as feeling out of place in a new city it s totally normal That s how I felt about Maui the entire time I was there I kept thinking I was just picky weird anti social or otherwise mentally unstable because I just didn t feel right there I kept sticking it out another month because I thought eventually the majestic wonders and buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days frolicking along the white sand swinging from jungle branches and blissfully speaking pidgin But it just never clicked I don t really know why all I can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we know or would like to know It s definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something new every once in awhile Lord knows that s my modus operandus but I think you ll know if Denver is really your kind of town In the meantime just take it for what it is a fun place to be a young swingin single It ll take more than a month to adjust and meet people and even then you might not meet the kind of people you re ultimately looking for Sorry to sound so pessimistic I m really not maybe I ll just employ my favorite analogy to explain when you walk into Mimi Lena or Fred Segal or even Nordstrom and you start perusing the racks how long does it take you to decide whether or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something A minute Seconds maybe But you don t have to camp out in the store for several hours or days just hanging out with your skirt of choice to decide if you want to take it home with you Granted this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a habitat but you get the picture Which leads me to my next point men Same goes for them If there are characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl it doesn t matter if he s Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces of well some guy with social graces IT WILL NOT WORK Run don t walk away from a situation like this I have just one word to describe to you what can happen with guys like this BRIAN He was sooo sweet soooo smart soooo in love with me and even tolerable to look at But soon the walls came crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness which was mild to begin with escalated as he felt me pulling away It all ended in that debacle we know as Brian s Trip to Portland It was hauntingly uncomfortable and all I can tell you is nobody could have warned me I was blinded by something akin to love but much more akin to an ego trip which was what I was on everyday with him because he pretty much thought I was God s gift and made sure I knew it constantly Listen I have to go and I ve said my piece for the day I ll try and give you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject When you really get down to it you re doing great exactly what anyone and everyone at your age and mine is doing which is basically wondering what the hell to do with the rest of our lives And meanwhile the rest of our lives are slipping past unnoticed Just remember the John Lennonn quote Life is what happens when you re busy making other plans Now THERE s a real man Whoa

are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing else on a letter requiring a signature Hourly deals will not be confirmed So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are entering deals The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact name It stops the whole process We are not going to be able to put names in every time they do not If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list put the correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry and we will add this contact to the list and it

Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different counterparties The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data to ensure its accuracy Averaged together these prices become

sales to reach an average of all the prices It would be redundant for each counterparty to ALSO report their purchases from each other Therefore when calculating the Dow Jones data we only include

watch two fabulous films The Virgin Suicides and Croupier both of which I highly recommend We built a gigantic bed out of couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon and I was amazingly more angry than I had previously thought mostly because she walked into the house smacking of defensiveness ready to fight

didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports they re not battling with that ol Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean Well I m sorry I didn t get back to you yesterday work was hectic and I knew that if I started an e mail to you it would either be half assed or I d never finish it Well I m going for the former now because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what s happening around here and all the while I wait more and more important nuggets get it of gossip are accumulating So it s quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues mine could not be worse Amber took off for the library on Thursday night and came home four days later After Molly and I had a mild freak out session on Friday which included calling everybody she s every known including Chris and the police we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch of Neidermeyer cousin fame was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and James Bond like rendezvous at the beach Well that was all well and fine other than the fact that she DIDN T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn t told our landlords or paid the 500 deposit oh and also SHE DIDN T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING So many things were wrong and bizarre about that but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon Let s just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish childish idiotic and most importantly psychotically self important behavior She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didn t tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN T WANT TO LIE Hmmmm Not only did she not want to lie how sweet but she couldn t have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber s love trysts Now I KNOW there s nothing I d rather be doing Anyway enough of that She and I have reached an understanding that just because we re roommates does not mean we have to be friends We ve never been good at that anyhow In other news we had an amazing housewarming party I really wish you could have been there Molly and I didn t know 90 percent of the people there which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting successful gracious and cute I think there were about four girls there you could tell who planned the party Sadly no love connections were made that evening but I ve decided that s my new M O keep em guessing My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food Wine magazine Very interesting guy but potentially in the closet so I m keeping my distance But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a five course meal and 100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude s mansion Definitely sounds like my crowd Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans I ve got my eye on flights to Denver but right now it s looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets That s fair for ya Okay that s all I can do for now but call me tonight and we ll do the rumor mill justice Take care and hang in there we ll be booting a roommate soon

your fever I d feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain In fact I promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday so I d have a partner in my time of homebound misery She took it a step further in true drama queen fashion Case in point I m at work she s rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in bed Anyway I m going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today because

that s fine if you bring the discrepancies by later Or I can swing by your desk to get them I think I know why Mark is confused about the price At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them which is all we had been doing to cover their load before We determined however that when EPMI buys from EES the price should be 5 less than our fixed price average for the day When EPMI sells to EES the price is 5 more than the fixed price average In this way we re still making our profit from the coverage of their load Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we sent them or we purchased at the wrong price we were working the kinks out right at the beginning of March so it makes sense that they d have questions regarding that time frame Also I ve already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some discrepancies with him He asked about volumes at the beginning of March but didn t

Anna my most favorite sister of them all I m sorry I ve been so bad about staying in touch while you ve been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life It sounds like things are going really well though Rocky Mountain highs and that you ve made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place Rocky Mountain lows Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky her man of the hour he mentions how they ve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next Friday whoo hoo party I m so mad that she gets to go and I don t being that I am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as Spring Break Mania anymore And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she d love to hang out with you more often It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner eh So you ve got options girlfriend which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo It pretty much consists of working eating and sleeping I m definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing because I think it s got me in its clutches But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter We re doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house it s like having three Martha Stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk Other than that I ve been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little post it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain I m actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes but let s not get wild and crazy just yet So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile That is in the immortal words of the guys in Dude where s my car SWEET DUDE You are stoked I bet that s a major load off just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head Take it from one who knows I m seriously looking into buying an old beater car but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro and suddenly 30 000 doesn t seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool Lately I ve been doing a lot of research into self improvement measures I just applied for post baccalaureate status at U of O so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online I just got my new FREE computer from work I m also studying for the GRE and pretty soon here I m going to get serious about graduate school I think I ve decided on international studies and or economics depending on how well I like the classes I take I ve found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D C It s a two year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends in are you sitting down Bologna Italy Holy shit does it get more perfect Apparently it s like the premiere training ground for government officials according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it But I figure I m not getting any younger and I don t want any regrets so I m goin for it dude As for the love life it s nonexistant which is why I m putting so much energy into the self improvement area of my life I figure as long as I m having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value By the time they come around again the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 million Whatever Anyway now that I ve written you the longest paragraph of my life I must retreat to my work duties Then it s off for a thrilling tour of Portland via Tri Met Molly s making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume It s only taken her 3 years to compile the information for it so this one should be a doozy Hey if you can ever make it home for a weekend you should come at the end of May David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer and it s going to be fabulous I ll buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket Call me soon if you can or I ll call this weekend

what the heck is zero week I might be interested in signing up for that pack in some quick credits for my pre grad school work I figured out I m going to essentially have to get a second bachelor s degree before going to grad school But hey it s all about the credentials man as in being able to tell people at my 10 year high school reunion that I have two bachelor s degrees a master s and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian wine in a 12th century villa surrounded by buff tan and unusually good looking farm workers Tres important So yeah maybe we ll hold off on the visit for now I think it s more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now then we party I could maybe make it out there in April overlap with mom s trip I don t think I could handle the whole thing with her I ll keep it in mind And yeah she s giddy about this whole house move thing I hope it works out for the best I really think it will I m starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her but I m in a weird situation with Amber s cat at our house already Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it s my house too but the other part of me doesn t want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Amber s outmatched feline Oh well I m thinking about it The most excitement I ll be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn t insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer And as the sands flow these are the days of our lives I m so impressed with your dating maneuvers I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison Like sister like sister I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters go figure Anyway it s time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt Can t wait Write back soon Kate Anna Symes annas cobs edu on 03 14 2001 09 18 15 AM To Kate Symes enron com Kate Symes enron com cc Subject RE I m so glad to hear everything s better at your house I totally want to come visit but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to 0 so it may be awhile I m definitely coming in June when I take a zero week class in Eugene Mom s supposedly coming out here in April and we might go to Glenwood Springs hot springs spa MASSAGES You should come too Fun female family bonding time I am so excited for Dad to visit not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100 I m a little worried about the effect it s having on Mom who asked me when he was coming so she wouldn t run into him Like I would allow that to happen how stupid does she think I am But it sounds like she s pretty stoked about this house thing so I m excited for her I have a date with that waiter guy tonight but I m not really that excited because I am fat ugly and on the third day of my period Did I mention broke and car less I think I should just put off this whole dating thing until I increase MY net value to use Kate speak which is just ground zero for most people I am trying to pay off some debt Dad took care of most of it but I didn t have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account It s slow going though And car payments will not make it easy but seriously this city is so pedestrian unfriendly that I feel I have no choice I tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes And every person in Denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby I am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman So I need a car and I don t care if it means weekly visits to the plasma donation center I actually met Marky s ex the other night maybe don t mention to Amber I don t know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out of it Anyway she is really cool She reminds me of my friend Jen Sturmer except less anorexic and depressed Speaking of have you been going out in Portland a lot I miss Veritable Quandary I haven t found anything like that here yet Downtown has some cool bars but you have to pay 90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either My neighborhood has some good dives like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing Don s Mixed Drinks not sure but think that s the name of the bar I went in once and met Don the king of multiple body piercings here in Denver Okay I m rambling Time to get back to work which is so good lately by the way I get to start grant writing this month Hope all s well for you I ll give you the dirt on my date later if my acne doesn t scare him away in minute one Miss you love you Love yo sista ","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2001-03-14

i m so happy for you re the love thing love is sooooo in the air lately molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to they ve been attached at the hips literally for the last three weeks and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky then cries when she has to hang up seriously but your romance sounds much more interesting you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds and what s the guy s name anyway you know what s weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner we decided to check out the brazen bean this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on 21st we heard they had a martini happy hour and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated so we re walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs it s in one of those old rambling victorian houses so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them it turns out to be blake and jill this really sweet couple i ve met before friends of friends you know how it goes anyway we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvet couched candle lit shi shi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt so dave molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY i ve noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics well who isn t y know he also likes to sail and this is really quite scary LASER SAILBOATS yep i ve officially met my father in a younger form barf anyway he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date it was all very intellectual i assure you what was weirder still was that every time i said something dave looked at blake and kind of laughed and every time i was like stop your laughing or i ll beat you senseless and he was like no i m just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because i ve done that or because i m doing that next week i said i wanted to start a book club apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back he s going there in two months oh and then there s our common love of running okay i m rambling so i ll get to the point which is that in my single and cynical state i didn t think much of the poor guy last night but today i ve noticed i m increasingly interested and i ll admit maybe even attracted so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland and went on my merry way with molly and josh which i m sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into dave s car and run away dave got in his car and drove off then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn t start a book club without each other s contact information i already knew he worked at a running store whatever that is but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word owner underneath do you think that means he s the actual owner or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them employee owners i m going to look into it now i m probably making way too much of this because he was probably like yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely don t want to talk to this drinking smoking lump of unmolded flesh for any other reason why would i the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat that would just be silly okay i ve got to go get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you kate Anna Symes annas cobs edu on 03 15 2001 09 47 21

have come across EVER He s trying to get a job in graphic design so cute but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a restaurant so cute We ve read all the same books He definitely has money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can see where I m coming from He was just interested enough but kind of aloof which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested Kate this is so weird Oh and he mentioned having a family twice like as in working at a restaurant isn t good for having a family HOW CUTE IS THAT I am in love Just thought I d let

from the land of watery eyed flat assed office workers How goes the burly mountain man thing I ve been hearing second hand from Elliot that you re faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes That second part I made up but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation All s well here As you could imagine and probably often do the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left There are still many computers many of them have changed positions some have gone away most we are not sad to see go That s just the nature of this cutthroat business Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron I am still here I still stare at the computer Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black They are incredibly helpful I am still pretty much clueless about most things although I ve learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority as in No you twit the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP 15 to NP 15 because of the illiquidity of SP s market right now What kind of idiot wouldn t hedge their position in California at a time like this It all sounds very exotic and important to me which is why I m still here But I m infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer so I m planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown I haven t decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris Both sound good and way beyond my budget therefore equally attractive Well I ve managed to say practically nothing for long enough now I do hope you re having an amazing time rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote We re all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as my good friend Winston who s skiing across the state of Wyoming which was my idea I d love to hear about your trip direct from the source although I know you re extremely busy out there skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot But please do write back if you can still move your fingers Sincerely Kate the slightly ditsy one who sits in the

You re stoked on the song thing You ll never guess how cool mine is though It s Don t go breakin my heart by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous e mail so I ll just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly You re the only one who s managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Don t be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didn t understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night line up All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about 8 30 Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Dave s friend s girlfriend who I m also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was that or so I thought At about 10 p m runner man himself calls and basically admits that he s psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn t want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you d reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now that s finance lingo Anyway the plan is he s going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I don t remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when you re home in June because it s a constant riot I won t go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but I ll tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think it s just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go I ll call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes annas cobs edu on 03 23 2001 08 06 18 AM To Kate Symes enron com Kate Symes enron com cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isn t the last we ll be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn t need to

may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on God s green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that you re not that into it And being a man only men and Symes s do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so
