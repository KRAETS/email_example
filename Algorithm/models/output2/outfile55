ve been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from EOL I ve used this to build a real time matrix which shows spread relationships

homemade format For example Hunter and I were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps storage utilization logic etc If we can develop an EOL dependent application that is helpful to our customers in

thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 8 15 8 30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone s mind Would it be okay to delay EOL market making in basis until 8 30 I think it would be worth it I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups origination who structuring who Julie Gomez and Fred Lagrasta on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA s basis positions Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions Should we set up a new book under my management which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and or more complex structured positions I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being cluttered up in different books i e the P L from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me It seems like more intense leadership might provide an extra
