and 11 point The 10 point grossed 135 B C swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr third largest ever For calibration mine grossed 166 I have one good 8 point that s about 18 wide and 4 5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting I m still open to you going there to take pictures It may be hard to schedule but I really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and tkae some pics on your own I ve got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown whatever Call me at 281 807 6802 if you are interested and we can work it out Melissa and Hunter are doing well

20 Broad Horizons 20 20 by Jeff Schlegel 20 20 December 2000 Worth magazine 20 20 Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear t 20 of the new economy 20 20 Enron NYSE ENE President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling 20 hates his office a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company s 20 downtown Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain To Skilling its 20 haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind set from the days when energy 20 markets 20 were highly regulated Instead he prefers strolling through Enron s three 20 commodity trading floors 01 the company s nerve centers where it buys an d 20 sells products 20 ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth The 20 often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the 20 traders That s 20 how you find out what s going on he says Skilling doesn t think like an old line energy executive nor does Enron ac t 20 like an old line energy company With its eclectic product mix and strong 20 online presence Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin g 20 to capitalize on deregulation The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas 20 and electric power markets that began in the mid 1980s has left both 20 industries in a tizzy A dearth of new power supplies combined with 20 insatiable demand 20 has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and 20 their customers That suits Enron just fine New Economy Initiatives The company which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from 20 its regulated gas pipeline business has become the nation s largest buyer and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful 20 trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities But what ha s 20 really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron s new economy 20 initiatives First it launched EnronOnline an Internet based energy tradi ng 20 system in November 1999 By mid October 2000 the new venture had executed 20 more than 350 000 transactions with a gross value totaling 183 billion 20 Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both 20 delivering content along its own sizable fiber optic network and trading bandwidth as a commodity The nascent broadband services group had 345 20 million in revenue for the first nine months of this year Although energy remains Enron s main source of revenue and earnings 20 management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t ap into new markets In five years we will be a substantially different 20 company says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay Underlying 20 everything we 20 do is the ability to make markets more efficient Along with bandwidth 20 Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel and pulp and paper to it s 20 trading platform which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips 20 and data storage Trading is the ultimate scalable concept adds Skilling 20 We re using the same computer systems processes controls and people The 20 potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited Investors have bought into Enron s vision and sent its shares soaring whic h 20 at a recent price of 80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000 Th e 20 big question of course is how much of that euphoria is already built into 20 Enron s stock price and what happens if the company s broadband strategy 20 doesn t 20 unfold as quickly 01 or become as huge 01 as the company anticipates We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly 20 suited for the changing economy 01 Jeff Skilling President and COO Enron Company Culture Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission From 20 management down employees have little doubt that they re creating 20 revolutionary new businesses This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at 20 Enron s headquarters where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a 20 ticker tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron s stock price Management Ken Lay 57 assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986 not long after 20 the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas 20 where he had been chairman and CEO The two pipeline companies had joined 20 forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being deregulated In the past government authorities set the price that utiliti es 20 could charge for gas and customers were bound by rigid long term contract s 20 But 20 with deregulation the market determines energy prices and both suppliers 20 and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods The new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating a 20 trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers Enron repeated the 20 process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market 20 in the 1990s Lay has long been hailed as Enron s visionary but COO Skilling is no slouc h 20 Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I ve ever known sa ys 20 Lay 20 who began working with him in the mid 1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey 20 consultant helping Enron develop its gas trading system I ve made it clea r 20 for some time that he s my successor The 46 year old Skilling who officiall y 20 joined Enron in 1990 likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when describing the company s business Lay s language is slightly less colorfu l 20 but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron s future Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the 20 bottom We ve flattened the organization made it more entrepreneurial an d 20 developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas Lay says Take Michae l 20 Moulton 30 who is working in Enron s pulp and paper trading unit Moulton 20 came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips and when the new uni t 20 begins its operations later this year he will run it Wholesale Energy Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations Enron is 20 still at its core an energy company During the first nine months of this 20 year 20 nearly 56 billion of its 60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale 20 energy operation which centers around making markets in and creating 20 risk management 20 products for natural gas and electricity Some of what Enron sells comes fr om 20 its own gas production and electric power generation but the bulk of it is 20 bought 20 from other energy producers with excess capacity The company s trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from 20 EnronOnline which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume 20 Margins are razor thin 01 maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt of 20 electricity standard contract measures But Enron isn t doing trades just 20 to 20 make money it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable it 20 to package together risk management products such as futures and swap 20 contracts that companies can use to hedge their energy costs Enron is a 20 principal in every trade taking full responsibility for actual delivery of 20 the product 20 be it gas electricity or even pulp and paper Overall margins in the 20 wholesale energy business average one to three percent Trading is a risky business of course but few companies manage risk bette r 20 than Enron which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri ce 20 moves Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best 20 modeling systems hires the brightest people and has trading experience 20 throughout 20 the country says Gregory Phelps a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund s 20 who closely follows the utilities sector Enron employs a dozen 20 meteorologists 20 on its gas trading floor to monitor any weather changes 01 from an oncomi ng 20 cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico 01 th at 20 could affect 20 supply and demand Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe which is in the early stages of 20 deregulation Enron established a presence in the U K Germany and 20 Scandinavia 20 in the early to mid 1990s It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries 20 making markets and hedging risks in a region where state owned utilities 20 still loom large and 20 national differences present formidable hurdles We re the only company wi th 20 pan European operations says Mark Frevert who heads the wholesale energy unit There s a lot of complexity but we like markets where it s 20 difficult Broadband Operations The roots of Enron s bandwidth trading go back to 1997 when the company 20 bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ y market At the time the utility was laying fiber optic cable alongside it s 20 gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City and as it was 20 being deployed 20 the Enron mind set of Can we trade this stuff kicked in says Kenneth 20 Rice CEO of Enron Broadband Services Bandwidth lends itself well to bein g 20 traded like 20 a commodity Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from 20 carriers such as AT T NYSE T Global Crossing NYSE GX and Qwest NYSE Q As it does with energy Enron bundles together bandwidth then 20 sells and delivers it on an as needed basis to content providers network 20 carriers and other end users Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and 20 for a specified period over a fiber optic network that stretches nearly 20 15 000 miles and connects some 30 major cities in the United States Europe and Japan Enron is certainly ambitious It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold 20 which up until now has been in fixed rate monthly contracts that lock buyer s 20 into 20 paying for capacity they don t always need Enron provides bandwidth on 20 demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period s 20 of 20 time 01 for instance if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o f its 20 CEO to its offices around the globe The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a 20 monthly contract for DS 3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o n 20 a Global Crossing network DS 3 is an industry standard for moving data at a 20 speed of 45 megabits per second fast enough for streaming video Enron delivered 1 399 months worth of DS 3 broadband capacity in the third 20 quarter alone and is on target to meet its year end goal of 5 000 DS 3 20 months Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute 1 billion in 20 annual operating profits in five years or nearly as much as wholesale ener gy 20 contributed 20 in 1999 Meanwhile the company expects to pour another 650 million into 20 broadband services during each of the next two years offset by the pending 20 2 20 billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The other major piece of Enron s broadband strategy centers on delivering 20 streaming video Using Sun Microsystems Nasdaq SUNW servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies NYSE LU and Cisco Systems Nasdaq CSCO 20 along with its own internally developed software Enron s broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams Content customers ran ge 20 from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster NYS E 20 BBI 20 which this summer inked a 20 year deal to distribute video on demand over 20 Enron s network Video will be the king application Skilling says That s 20 where 20 it s all going to happen Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enron s decision to plunk down 100 million 20 for the 30 year naming rights to Enron Field the Houston Astros new 20 retractable dome baseball stadium But the deal also helped Enron seal a 20 30 year 200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the 20 stadium So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made 100 20 million in the process Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market considering that U S 20 businesses spend more than 240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei r 20 operations every year Enter Enron Energy Services which does everything 20 from analyzing a company s energy supply chain to pinpointing its 20 energy guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more efficient 20 gear The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group NYSE SPG before making recommendations that landed it a 10 year 1 5 20 billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon s 253 real estate 20 properties The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you re 20 going to be the leader you ve got to know every detail says Marty Sunde head of the group s North American unit Energy savings can be significant Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent bu t 20 sometimes the savings can be even greater The business which began 20 in 1997 recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings 20 before interest and taxes or EBIT of 80 million this year Enron is on 20 target to 20 land 16 billion in customer contracts in 2000 double last year s total 20 There s no reason this business can t roughly double in each of the next f ew 20 years 20 Lay says Enron is very very confident Their tone borders on excessive confidence 20 but their track record warrants that 01 Erik Gustafson Senior Portfolio Manager Stein Roe Farnham The Competition Some of Enron s trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t he 20 deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications Dynegy NYSE DYN located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a nd 20 called Enron Jr by at least one analyst has its own gas and 20 electricity trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading The 20 same goes for Williams Companies NYSE WMB whose fiber optic network is much larger than Enron s A consortium of six energy companies including 20 Aquila Energy a leading power marketer just launched an online 20 energy trading 20 system to rival EnronOnline Several existing bandwidth traders including Arbinet thexchange RateXchang e 20 AMEX RTX and Band X essentially provide Web based bulletin boards for companies to find trading partners They don t actually deliver the 20 product which Enron feels gives it an advantage In the energy services 20 business 20 Enron competes with a whole host of players including consultants regiona l 20 utilities and energy outsourcers but none have Enron s geographic scope It s a challenge to value Enron s stock because it s such a hybrid It 20 always seems expensive but it continues to outperform expectations 01 Zach Wagner Analyst Edward D Jones Co What It s Worth Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along 20 its four reported business lines using a sum of the parts model They 20 also typically value the company s businesses in terms of EBIT judging tha t 20 to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron s income because its business es are so capital intensive Using those metrics and a recent stock price of 20 80 Enron s pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly 20 valued at 5 wholesale energy at 40 energy services at 20 and broadband services at 20 15 Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale 20 energy 20 is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this 20 year to 1 8 billion some 70 percent of Enron s projected total EBIT And 20 wholesale 20 energy s EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t he 20 next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy 20 markets 20 Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and 20 broadband 20 not to mention the potential for new commodity trading markets and Skilli ng 20 argues Enron s stock is easily worth 130 Analysts are more cautious Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a 20 higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay but bandwidth i s 20 still 20 a couple of years away from profitability In the meantime Salomon Smith 20 Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market 20 potential 20 of bandwidth trading and that the quick acceptance of this product in the 20 market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the 20 mid 1990s Niles thinks Enron s overall energy operations alone are worth more than 20 Enron s current share price If that s true tacking on the 15 EBIT value 20 for bandwidth would make Enron a 100 stock Ultimately many investors will look at plain old earnings per share If 20 Enron meets analysts consensus earnings forecast of 1 65 a share next yea r 20 01 and maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings 01 it would be worth 92 Social Responsibility Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce 20 methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind power division But 20 certain Enron projects such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant in 20 India have been mired in controversy The state police there squelched 20 protests 20 against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings and Human 20 Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th e 20 suppression of dissent and didn t speak out against human rights violations 20 Enron has since built a 50 bed hospital in the area and committed 500 000 to improve the community s water and sanitation infrastructures The Upside With less than half of the residential power market in the U S open to 20 competition electricity deregulation is far from over Some analysts belie ve 20 the entire 20 market will be deregulated within five years This would enable Enron to 20 expand its leading energy trading business On the retail side Enron could 20 get a 20 boost from the New Power Company a partnership it formed with AOL NYSE 20 AOL and IBM NYSE IBM aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via the Internet Enron s attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi a 20 ended in failure in 1998 and the company readily admits this isn t one of 20 its strengths 20 So it s relying on IBM s back office expertise to handle the paperwork and 20 AOL s Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power The Downside The much ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations 20 Currently only five percent of U S households have broadband access and Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so called 20 last mile connections which take broadband signals into homes is moving 20 very 20 slowly She doesn t expect wide scale availability of video on demand befor e 20 2004 Who Needs It Enron s mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most 20 conservative investors Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it a 20 stable source of cash flow while its new Internet based ventures give it t he 20 great growth potential of a tech stock 20 20 ","sent_time":"2001-02-01 04:06:00-08:00","message_subject":"Enron

want to make sure I don t go back to El Paso and ask questions they ve already answered 1 What is the name of the delivery point If Ellisburg can EES deliver this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage 2 Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible If interruptible will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm storage commitments What does interruptible mean 3 How long can EES carry the volumes in storage What are the TGP cost of carry in storage What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage Are there any IN STORAGE transfer costs 4 What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage 5 What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach project Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time Can EES inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized 6 What are the possible other alternate delivery points Will there be a basis difference from Ellisburg Will these alternate delivery points be firm deliveries What will the MDQ be at these points 7 If possible can EES pick an alternate delivery point as our primary point of delivery for this project I ll be in touch on Thursday

for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the money Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this week as well If you haven t already I m sure that you can broach the subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked Anyway Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she wasn t able to prove to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not working outside the home For the record she busts her ass keeping our house clean clothes washed and ironed meals cooked and doing lots of things to make sure we have a happy healthy and well adjusted son If there is a way later that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on these jabs when we next visit it will go a long way toward ensuring a good Christmas for everyone

of Enron Corp NYSE ENE Quotes News Boards were smacked around again yesterday following close on the heels of seven session decline that sent the stock down more than 13 points or 16 from its recent high of 84 63 December 28 all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility The pullback doesn t appear to be company specific exactly although the rumblings in a certain geographic region namely California are triggering aftershocks throughout the U S energy community As we outlined in a report on January 4 the energy situation in California has rapidly reached crisis proportions Strict environmental legislation and the uncertain profit potential post deregulation has kept utilities from installing sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years The state s two major utilities PG E Corp NYSE PCG Quotes News Boards and Edison International NYSE EIX Quotes News Boards are facing the prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity purchased on the open market However the rates the utilities can charge their customers for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the gradual rollout of full scale deregulation The risks to Enron are two fold For one the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the state s major wholesale energy providers including Enron Although the company does operate in California the bottom line impact would likely be shielded to a considerable degree because of Enron s size strength and diversified global revenue streams In addition Enron would likely be high on the list of default payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the region More significantly investors are concerned that California legislators may pull the plug on deregulation entirely or at least until the current crisis abates Some also fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended economic consequences Neither scenario is probable For one thing the airline industry was deregulated in fits and starts with plenty of mistakes and recrimination along the way And a strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best course of action this week It appears inevitable that regardless of PG E and Edison s ultimate fate the state s energy consumers will likely absorb much of the burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks on the heels of the Federal Reserve s unexpected interest rate cuts last week The initial euphoria has waned however upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic economic growth rather than generating a rebound in economic activity As a result we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well capitalized defensive plays like Enron We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron s favor have been overlooked amid the California crisis The November December period was 18 colder than normal and the second coldest start to the winter months in the past 50 years Coupled with an uncertain supply situation particularly in natural gas Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing an environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months In addition Enron s diversification into still more new avenues of growth help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the future The markets for EnronOnline a real time commodities exchange vehicle and Enron s broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next year An eventual inflection point in the groups profitability would serve to send profits measurably higher in the long term Despite the recent turmoil Enron s consensus earnings estimate for 2001 according to First Call has come down a mere penny to 1 65 a share Although the stock s rich price earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near term volatility the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the market approves of Enron s maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going forward ","sent_time":"2001-01-10

will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer 4 For the winter months of October through April the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft Pierce is not dispatched thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500 This equates to 35 251 MMBTU day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours 6 per hour 5 Because Ft Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below 6 Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate less the monthly capacities available from Ft Pierce via FGU These non FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below MONTH Total Capacity Needed By Enron Ft Pierce Capacity from FGU Phase

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10 year term gas 9 2001 8 2011 delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel The bid as of Tuesday s closing prices comes to 4 63 MMBTU with the following assumptions 1 Per Goeff Storey the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR Niagara curve 2 National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL Niagara system 3 Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this small size Let me know if you have any further questions Thanks Charlie ","sent_time":"2001-04-17
