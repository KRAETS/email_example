translation of a business problem for example complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality into the code Regarding Tanya s attitude Just a few points 1 I don t think she has the skills to do the system administrator s work and she does not have the necessary privileges This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help It s not that the work is beneath her 2 Some members of Tanya s team came to me complaining about Winston He effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the IT issues I don t think that it s just Tanya s issue though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful 3 The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code The bottom line is that we are in full agreement Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that it happens Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail Vince From Stephen Stock ENRON enronXgate on 01 11 2001 08 23 AM To Vince J Kaminski HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Progress Vince I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems In particular distributed processing Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous occasions Do you feel the need to discuss these further The multi language issue isn t really that much of an issue as the current system is 98 java right now Although I am a big fan of C C it is my main development skill I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved and robust language I had serious doubts about the performance but I ve had a review conducted and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C C because of something they call Hot Spot technology its an instruction caching technique I believe The concerns I expressed to you were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability On the issue of distributed processing the original review I had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution and as Zhiyong Wei is already working on Global Valuation project Winston is actively working with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that and also to find a common Valuation piece between the systems I d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days Also I sat in on the Tanya Winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code I e Seperating research domain problems from IT problems She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were I asked her how she would measure that and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points I mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her Tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code and that studying documentation wasn t enough About 6 weeks ago I commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon in fact I ve asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now and Winston is also working on a draft Research IT working together document which will identify how the exchange of information takes place Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do all the environment setup for her because she doesn t really want to have to do that I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue The IT guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her She is claiming that they are un cooperative they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set up over and over again and doesn t seem to want to learn how to do it Winston on the other hand could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an IT issue and ask for help from research I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days and Debbie Brackett and I will review their progress on Friday In the meantime l ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn t involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution Regards Steve

transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry members within the last year Consequently our business processes are not well developed One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested in market related research I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board that sees the value of market related research I already have a verbal commitment from people at Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC With members like Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed not funded in this round Please let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron I am going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and could come through Huston for a visit Attached are some items that I shared with our PSERC members and

interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about risk return valuation of assets for utilities I thought I would mention to you however that when decisions are quantified utilities usually use classical decision analysis i e von Neuman utility curves If the decision is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly it is the President s curve if the decision would be covered in rates it is the customers curves or equivalently the PUC s curve I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the assumptions of Black Scholes do not apply I would start with the CAPM for large industries in an area use pro formas to translate this to utility curves for the input commodities and add the utility curves Another issue The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its role in the market In the 1930s Keynes argued that if most market participants with long position were hedgers futures prices would be higher than spot if they were speculators or traders future prices would be lower than spot Traders must be compensated for holding the risk hedgers including utilities and consumers are willing to pay a premium for the certainty

on the power situation in India published by The Financial Times The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting millions of people One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the Dhabol plant expensive as it may be The power cut affected 230 million people The second article is Enron specific Vince ASIA PACIFIC Power failure hits north India Financial Times Jan 3 2001 By ANGUS DONALD Tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern India yesterday after a power grid breakdown Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital New Delhi with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day according to power grid officials The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry Assocham a leading business organisation expressed deep concern and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could cripple the economy The power failure across eight Indian states including New Delhi disrupted train services water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators The fault occurred on the Northern Grid which provides electricity for 226m people and affected the states of Delhi Haryana Punjab Uttar Pradesh Himachal Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir A breakdown at a sub station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh India s most populous state caused an overload of power on other lines which then failed as well Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged New Delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged We will probe into the reasons for the failure It is most likely to be a technical failure but we will investigate why it happened Suresh Prabhu the power minister was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India India suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure Theft of supplies is also a big problem Thirty per cent of the country s electricity is stolen according to analysts In New Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen Two years ago a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh and Delhi for hours Assocham issued a statement saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by India s inefficient power sector The slow progress particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further Copyright The Financial Times Limited Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2000 FT and Financial Times

operating in India writes Khozem Merchant Financial Times Jan 3 2001 By KHOZEM MERCHANT Enron the US energy producer and a constant target of criticism in India is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational Its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers follows the west Indian state of Maharashtra s decision to review the tariff it pays the Texas based company whose Dollars 2 2bn electricity generating plant at Dabhol is India s biggest single foreign investment Maharashtra s tariff has more than doubled since 1993 and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers IPPs The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel The state also pays a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m Dollars 21m a month reflecting the huge project cost and controversially irrespective of consumption A showdown looks inevitable reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged India s appeal to foreign investors A former official of the World Bank which has criticised the deal says Enron is emerging as the East India Company of the 21st century a reference to the British trader that colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th century The stand off is the latest blot on India s power sector The UK s PowerGen and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently frustrated by long approval procedures inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere India has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points says Gerry Grove White former India general manager of PowerGen which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat to China Light Power of Hong Kong India s national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity must rise by 40 000MW to about 120 000MW But since 1992 IPPs have added only 3 000MW and 2 500MW remains under construction This is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth Enron was a bellwether of India s liberalisation winning fast track project approval in the early 1990s Phase 1 a 740MW plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in May 1999 and phase 2 a Dollars 1 87bn plant of 1 624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas LNG will be completed this year Only two of seven other fast track proposals have achieved financial closure From the outset Enron encountered attacks culminating in Maharashtra s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous Vilasrao Deshmukh chief minister of the successor government says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable Enron whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment Enron views India as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad based trader of commodities such as energy gas and bandwidth To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states once legislation is passed this year It is building an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas And it is laying a 15 000km fibre optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity In any event Enron believes it has a watertight contract It is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of Maharashtra India s financial and industrial hub as an unreliable destination for investment Mr Deshmukh who has avoided the language of his predecessor which threatened to dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition But his options are limited Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders Maharashtra State Electricity Board the local utility and Enron s main client is obliged to dispatch or off take 90 per cent of Dabhol s output Yet MSEB has never honoured these guarantees Its off take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and in effect MSEB has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power One reason off take is low is because the state s tough new regulator has told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources Enron says the tariff would be Rs4 02 kWh if MSEB s off take averaged 90 per cent But with off take a third lower the average tariff is Rs4 94 per unit and often higher In October the tariff was Rs6 91 per unit when off take was about 49 per cent Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 run on cheaper LNG starts These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2 Enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer Enron s difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs which have failed to deliver the flood of investments Potential IPPs feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power Reform of state electricity boards whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers as well as transmission and distribution T D services to check huge theft and technical losses is overdue Given the limited resources money would be better spent on T D rather than on new plant says Oliver Blackaby managing director of N M Rothschild in India which is advising Karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network For the moment attention is fixed on Enron s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients As Sanjay Bhatnagar chief executive officer of Enron India said in a recent trade magazine one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility to deal with externalities Copyright The Financial Times Limited Copyright The

model and the Movement model FMC Model provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33 industry offsets Each day this model takes the previous day s trader curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed swap prices Placement Model uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using dummified ranges for Market Capitalization Liquidity KMV Score etc One main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade names Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for separate sunsets of names Movement Model provides an alert system for news This is under development Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the development modifications of the Placement Model especially in thinking through the various single vs multi model approaches We can help in the brainstorming for better models for subsets One main project right now is to get a separate model for subsidiaries and to exclude subsidiary names from the main regression Value at risk is based on historical variance covariance approach The portfolio model is under development Agenda for Houston Research Group members Once sufficient data is collected start reviewing for potential analytic relationships Get weekly updates from London and provide feedback Plan on a trip if the work warrants it once the agenda is fairly well drawn out

An employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it In many similar cases courts subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double standard in

the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power In this regard I have just given a

forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint I look forward to hearing from you Sincerely yours Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading PS Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power 1 Valery A Kholodnyi The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power Preprint TXU RAG 01 00 July 2000 2 Valery A Khlolodnyi Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes Preprint TXU RAG 05 00 August 2000 3 Valery A Kholodnyi Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with Spikes Preprint TXU RAG 21 00 November 2000 4 Valery A Kholodnyi Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices Preprint TXU RAG 24 00 November 2000 5 Valery A Kholodnyi Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with Spikes Preprint TXU RAG 25 00 November 2000 As I have indicated to you in my previous e mail contrary to the standard approaches I model spikes directly as self reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non Markovian process even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes

without my introduction as a professional courtesy I would like you to benefit from my experience with this fellow The guy s name is Joao Neves Portugese I think he is reasonably bright and seems to have a quite deep understanding of general finance and financial mathematics He is a manager and feels very frustrated because he had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority Instead the group s M D brought in two Price Waterhouse Coopers consultants as V P s to run the structuring and quant sides of the group In this respect I can understand his unhappiness Unfortunately for him however I also think it is in his nature to whine I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people starting with the IT guys ok that s perhaps not much an indictment all the way to dismissing Broadie Glasserman s or Eduardo Schwartz works as shoddy or shallow He does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools Caveat Emptor therefore Having said all this I do want to emphasize that he is a bright guy is very pleasant with me and perhaps given the appropriate environment and supervision might be quite productive But don t take my word for it Talk to him and see what you think Obviously I would ask that you keep these comments in confidence I have given you an honest assessment brutally so Nuff said I have fulfilled my moral obligations both to Joao and to you Best Regards Grant

delegate pack for the Convention Given the break of the Christmas and New York period and that the event is being held in New York I am sure you can appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to be taken into account hence the reason why the presentations are required as soon as possible This is purely for reproduction we also request you bring your presentation to the Convention on the day in either a floppy disc or a laptop 2 Audio Visual Requirements can you please inform me of what audio visual requirements you may have 35mm slides OHP LCD projection notably

would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of this year to 2001 I could not use us all of my available vacation this year because of the following reasons 1 As you know I have been supporting three business units EES EPG Enron India this year All these units had difficult and relatively long projects that required experience in energy markets derivatives pricing and business knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron 2 There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me I now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year Of the current six members five joined us only this year and most of them didn t have any prior work experience thus requiring a lot of my time in recruiting training and mentoring 3 Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January 2000 for a business trip 10 days and will need to go there again in January 2001 I could not take leave from my work for the other two units EES EPG for an extended period of time So in summary this year has been a long and challenging one and as a result I could not take vacation for more than a few days I request you to grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and of these I expect to have 112 hours unused at the end of this year Thank you Krishna

Enron Enron Subject Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis Hi Vince Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before lending more credibility in the Ag community The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A M Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep and the focus is primarily to get a non quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk The pilot program itself will be very small and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination Another thought on hedging our potential short positon on the origination side is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received we still have unlimited downside from the short Vasant p s I am writing up Jim Bouillion s project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton Of course we may still ask Wharton for their insights on the corn price

Conference is already taking place I think it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round table discussion However I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion I ve been teaching a real options course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis Black Scholes pricing and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course However I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing trading and hedging with Excel VBA skills In fact he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations This is not to say that some of my other students aren t very talented themselves but that this person really stands out Do you think you and or Enron would be interested in such a person If so what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door His intention is to finish the MBA but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest

that he had made an error and that it should have been 120 000 I asked him what base salary he was looking for and he said he would expect at least a 10 increase in his base I then told him that I was not authorized to make an offer above our initial one and would contact you and get back to him I called him later that afternoon and asked him to fax me a copy of his last paycheck stub so that we could minimize the confusion about his base pay He said that he would be happy to do so but I never received the fax He left me a voicemail message during the evening that said he was on vacation and

people Thank you very much for setting it up and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people As I mentioned to John I am sending you the license paperwork for MarketPoint I have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration As I mentioned the license agreement covers the entire bundled product which includes North American gas short and long term North American electricity short and long term World gas Western European gas World oil We are just finishing porting the world oil world gas and western Europea n gas models over from our old now obsolete software system into MarketPoint so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months However the gas and electricity models for North America are presently complete and tested That should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business As I understood it you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil l want to defer decisions on electric or other capability As I mentioned at the meeting we are prepared to offer that for approximately 20 the fully bundled price As you read the license agreement you will see that the software licenses for 100 000 annually the gas data for 5 000 and the electric data for 10 000 MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for 20 the software license plus the data license for a total of 55 000 annually This is just under 20 the fully bundled price I think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting and from MarketPoint 01 s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with Enron If or when Enron ever desires to 01 scale up 018 to another model or model s from the MarketPoint portfolio we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement This will allow you to decouple the ga s decision from any other decisions you might make I will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy scope and operation of ou r approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs I thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam e time its simplicity and effectiveness I thought you were able to see the benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use I would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues I look forward to your response and to moving ahead together We view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business If you decide to license MarketPoint we can arrange to transfer and mount MarketPoint and the short term NARG model which is the model we suggest yo u begin with and travel to Houston to deliver our 1 20 day training seminar Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 20 day training seminar Thereafter we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a few weeks while you get up to speed very fluent and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks later Thanks again and all the best If there is some item

of finance at Mannheim University in Germany Currently he is writing a study about the hedging strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle For this study he would like to get forward oil prices form us The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 with remaining contract durations between one and ten years It would be ideal to get this data on a daily basis Weekly or monthly data is helpful as well of course Since Mannheim University is among Enron s tier one recruiting universities in Germany it would be great if we could help him with some data Thanks a lot for your help Jens o korn uni mannheim de on 10 10 2000 11 44 57 AM To Jens Gobel enron com cc Subject Daten Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof Buehler hat mich Prof Buehler gebeten Ihnen genauer darzustellen welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie benoetigt wuerden Zunaechst zum Hintergrund Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt In addition to the publicly available futures data described above for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1 15 93 to 5 16 96 From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation ranging in maturities from two months to nine years Dies laesst uns annehmen dass Enron bestimmte Daten verfuegbar hat Nun zum idealen Datensatz Forwardoelpreise am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing fuer Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996 Dabei waere eine hohe Datenfrequenz ideal taeglich ansonsten woechentlich oder monatlich Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht erfuellen lassen Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen wenn

Risk s course entitled Practical application of advanced stress testing which will be held in London 5 6 February 2001 and New York 12 13 February 2001 You have been recommended to me in the course of my research as an authority in this field so I would be delighted for you to present any of the sections that are still available on the attached programme For London sections 1 2 1 2 2 3 4 and For New York sections 1 2 1 2 2 4 and 8 My market research indicates that advanced stress testing is a highly interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative analysts and risk managers I anticipate the course to be technical and practical in nature and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates It aims to extend the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity and credit risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new risk measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated context Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section is most suitable for your current interests If you feel that you will not be able to participate on this occasion I would welcome any speaker suggestions you may have

light lies on these white walls this bed these hands I am nobody I have nothing to do with explosions I have given my name and my day clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut Stupid pupil it has to take everything in The nurses pass and pass they are no trouble They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps Doing things with their hands one just the same as another So it is impossible to tell how many there are My body is a pebble to them they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over smoothing them gently They bring me numbness in their bright needles they bring me sleep Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox My husband and child smiling out of the family photo Their smiles catch onto my skin little smiling hooks I have let things slip a thirty year old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations Scared and bare on the green plastic pillowed trolley I watched my teaset my bureaus of linen my books Sink out of sight and the water went over my head I am a nun now I have never been so pure I didn t want any flowers I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty How free it is you have no idea how free The peacefulness is so big it dazes you And it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets It is what the dead close on finally I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it like a Communion tablet The tulips are too red in the first place they hurt me Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly through their white swaddlings like an awful baby Their redness talks to my wound it corresponds They are subtle they seem to float though they weigh me down Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck Nobody watched me before now I am watched The tulips turn to me and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins And I see myself flat ridiculous a cut paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips And I have no face I have wanted to efface myself The vivid tulips eat my oxygen Before they came the air was calm enough Coming and going breath by breath without any fuss Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust red engine They concentrate my attention that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself The walls also seem to be warming themselves The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat And I am aware of my heart it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me The water I taste is warm and salt like the sea And comes from a country far away as health ","received_time":"2000-11-06

Shanbhogue HOU ECT ECT cc Steven Leppard LON ECT ECT Markus Fiala LON ECT ECT Subject Amitava s visit Really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the quantitative work we have undertaken As you are aware much of the work requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the significant contribution that Amitava s experience and expertise has provided in a very short timeframe As you might expect this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated support from someone with Amitava s background It is imperative that we leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights into our project This will not only speed up the work considerably but also ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more integrated into our efforts I realize it will be difficult to free him up but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody some early ideas have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support this should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC com resource working from Houston This is likely my preference or agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract his experience on an ongoing basis Let s discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities Thanks for your assistance

05:56:00-08:00","message_body":"Keith The article I mentioned Vince rashed By Tax Selling But are there bargains among the discards By Michael Santoli Here it is more than six months since even the most intransigent last minute filers wrote checks to the IRS to render to the government its due for their financial good fortune in 1999 By rights this should be a season relatively free of concerns about taxes notwithstanding the presidential candidates parrying over whose tax cut math features more fuzz And yet for anyone with a dollar in the stock market which in recent weeks has likely been reduced to loose change the looming demands of this year s levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet another taxing October for investors The jump and stumble course the major stock indexes have taken this year is being blamed for a particularly intense effort among mutual fund managers and other big investors to sell their losers The steep ramp up in stocks that persisted from the fall of 1999 through the first quarter of this year led by the technology must haves left funds with ripe profit taking opportunities when the Nasdaq surge flagged in April This sell high activity generated heavy capital gains in many portfolios tax liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with realized losses by selling stocks that have cratered The fact that so many funds are enduring a flat to down year in this difficult market has only added to the urgency Investors aren t fond of getting stuck with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of a bull market So managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders will react to funds kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of their holdings fails to appreciate or worse falls outright With the majority of funds operating on an October 31 fiscal year end and given a trend toward letting investors know their estimated tax hit well before year s end much of this selling has been concentrated in a brief period of weeks One fund executive attending a Fidelity mutual fund conference last week reported that oddly some managers have resolved to be contrary and overdo it in selling even their winners The theory he reports is that if they re going to have a capital gains distribution anyway the most skittish shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its tax liability whether it s say either 10 or 12 of net asset value So the idea is to take profits and reload for the benefit of those investors who will stick around Now with the Nasdaq off 22 7 since Labor Day and 8 so far in October much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the assault is ending This line of reasoning counsels that it s time to peek out of the foxhole and survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick up in expectation of a late year rally Not so fast While it s true that in past years these hard hit tax selling victims tend to recover in the early part of November the move often proves fleeting Like a ball being held under water these stocks jump when the downward pressure is released but that doesn t mean they escape gravity s pull for long Soon enough they re hit by a secondary wave of selling by investors who tidy up their tax situation closer to the end of the year The quantitative equity research team at Lehman Brothers has studied recent market history in search of patterns in tax driven selling In the process the analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look vulnerable to persistent weakness through most of the fourth quarter The study scanned the Russell 3000 index basically the 3 000 largest U S stocks for those that had fallen at least 40 this year through September and had lost at least 10 in the prior six months They also plucked only those stocks that had seen rising trading volume over that period The idea was to find only those names that seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo In 1997 there were just eight such stocks In 1998 there were 202 and last year 101 on a par with this year s tired crop Murali Ramaswami of Lehman says There s both a tax loss story and a momentum story Losers continue to be losers At least through the fourth quarter they do The negative momentum of these stocks tends to gather speed from the first week of November to Christmas In this period from 1997 through last year the Losers Portfolio dropped an average of 20 more than did the Russell 3000 index Bottom fishers beware The resulting list which Lehman billed to its institutional clients as a menu for hungry short sellers features numerous stocks caught in the major downside themes of the year Name a major telecom services provider and the odds are good it s in this bunch the result of a stampede away from the group Big retailers also dot the down on their luck roster as the slowing economy has ravaged shares of Circuit City Dillards Saks and others And of course there are plenty of dot com names experiencing the ugly side of a mania undone in a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the market s windshield Witness Barnesandnoble com and Razorfish An intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for next year s Comeback Stock of the Year will encounter no shortage of companies that appear for the moment broken and in need of an inspired strategic revamping some slick investor relations work and plenty of luck Former blue chips such as Lucent Technologies Bausch Lomb and Dial seem to fall into that club where for investors a love of dirt cheap stocks and a strong backbone is the price of admission DuPont which recently ratcheted down its 2001 growth forecast and is beset by high raw materials costs is arguably apt to remain in the investors time out chair for a while as well That its shares failed to sell off after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most hopeful sign one can seize on with regard to the chemicals giant Still for the investor patient enough to endure what could be a stormy November and December a few sizable companies with temporary problems but solid long term growth stories are attracting some fund managers looking to buy As detailed in Barron s last week Retailers on Sale October 23 there is reason to expect better performance from selected retail chains Federated Department Stores the parent of Macy s and Bloomingdale s merits attention both for its buoyant same store sales growth in a retail headwind and for its repair of the addled Fingerhut catalogue division which suffered a spike in delinquencies The shares are off their trough levels in the low 20s but a recent quote of 28 still seems a better than fair price for a company that some pros believe could earn more than 5 a share next year The advertising business this year is being given the cold shoulder by investors after a torrid love affair through 1999 Fearing that the dot com washout and resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad firms investors abandoned Interpublic the third largest owner of ad agencies after WPP and Omnicom But Mark Greenberg manager of the Invesco Leisure fund saw a chance to pick up a good solid company inexpensively when Interpublic hit the low 30s Now at 39 Interpublic is still fetching just 22 times forecast 2001 earnings which are expected to grow 15 faster than profits for the overall market I bought some early this year and added to it just recently The bad news is probably priced into the stock and then some he says Madison Avenue markdown Interpublic parent of McCann Erickson among other firms has always suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom a market darling considered the class operator in the industry But Interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation and is briskly expanding its direct marketing and public relations business which are growing faster than the traditional Madison Avenue game Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas and Interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis Communications a big coupon distributor which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your Sunday paper A well loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid cap fund manager in 1999 Valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories Investors bailed out in droves halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20 Now at 25 the shares are absurdly cheap says Greenberg who also owns Valassis Another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined Even with its growth forecast revised downward Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10 15 long term rate and earnings next year should rise close to 12 to 2 50 a share That leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year s profits And it s worth noting that in times of slower economic growth coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain hunters With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now it might feel as if the typical first quarter rebound in the year s losers that s been documented by Lehman Brothers is hopelessly distant If you re tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a beaten down mutual fund check first to see if it will be among those making a capital gains distribution later this year In that case you ll be on the hook for the tax even though you didn t participate in the gain You can take the plunge without worrying about payouts if you re buying the fund for a tax deferred account such as a 401 k or an IRA But at least in selected stocks it seems the machinations of tax fearing investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 25 off sale and you don t need to redeem a manufacturer s coupon to take advantage ","received_time":"2000-10-30

Raymond Cote is Vice President Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc a Montreal based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that combine advisory and systems development services to corporations and financial institutions Abstract Liquidity risk as opposed to credit and market risks has received little attention in professional or academic journals We argue that analyzing bank liquidity risk can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis After introducing some concepts and definitions the presentation defines a framework allowing to measure a bank s structural liquidity risk It then shows that combining the framework with modern credit risk measurement tools leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure The presentation then offers concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity risk measurement framework within enterprise wide risk management The Impact of Electronic Trading on the Uses of Quantitative Research in Equity Options September 22 2000

floor as soon as possible There is no need for him to remain on the floor 2 Determine where Anjam is heading We need to know who is going to know our positions and curves next IT type stuff 1 Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h drive since the rest of the group will need to support his work in the future This should take no more than a day or two 2 Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam s h drive for weekly intervals over the last two months This will allow us to determine what he has deleted 3 Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam s Notes folders and provide records of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months I m worried about code data he may have zipped up and mailed out 4 Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from Anjam s c

approached by John Martin a professor of finance at Baylor to write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal He wanted to work on an article on EBS I have suggested a different topic Enron Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself I made a few points to John a Enron s evolution did not just happen by accident It was a result of implementation of a far reaching strategy developed by the management b In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment I came up with a term proactive evolution as opposed to reactive evolution c The strategy included many elements including emphasis on the quality of human resources changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment d There are very few companies that match Enron s experience and accomplishemnts The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken

developments have created a number of unique challenges for energy industry economists One immediate question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices Although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are characterized by high variability the traditional measures used in financial economics annualized standard deviation of log price returns may not fit well electricity prices The second challenge is to explain the sources of high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run Such problems include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse market power limited availability and or unequal access to transmission temporary shortages of generation capacity Some factors underlying high volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer choice

based on 3 categories a variance covariance method b historical simulation c Monte Carlo simulation Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument 2 I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices rates etc and revaluation of the entire portfolio The revaluation may be based on an approximation using Taylor s expansion that may involve delta delta gamma delta gamma omega or may be exact based on the same model that produces the mark to market portfolio valuations The main benefit of using the MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way I would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V C model I shall send you the references from home 3 I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly new instruments for which we have no comparable prices behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de mature 4 For bigger portfolios virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem This process may be a source of a big error 5 The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error Many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments Please feel free to use any comment or none Vince Chris Strickland

your info to ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate for your employee population The generic forms that were presented at the PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees and to some extent commercial support employees and may not be entirely appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical areas I would appreciate your input on this so that if possible and time permitting we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the organization One simple solution may be to add a skills behaviors block requesting evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to the list of those already developed second

He is convinced that his skills and Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a local deal Also he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market rate Would you like to move further with this If so we can put together costs for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think I am

came back from Australia There are few things I would like to bring up to your attention First of all I would like to thank you for your hospitality I learned a lot about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the quality of the people at the Sydney office 1 The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help you with a phone interview 2 I have received another resume that looks very promising I am very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over to the States where we lack desperately technical talent Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney The main determination I need from you is whether he can function in a company like Enron As any good academic he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case you don t have a PostScript reader on your system 3 Christian Werner does some really neat things on the weather front I would like to determine if he can help us to upgrade our systems Can we bring him to Houston for a week to discuss the weather forecasting technology with Mike Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic I think that he could learn a lot from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate weather info into business related information I shall be glad to underwrite the cost of this trip Vince ","received_time":"2000-08-08

PM To Vince J Kaminski HOU ECT ECT Mike A Roberts HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Vince I have inquired into Christian s climate models It seems to me like a long term project Chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than the Australian Met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and that they are an old boy s network resistant to new developments but I don t think the same can be said of most other weather services As far as the NWS goes they run their model on a Cray they have several very talented PhD s working on it full time and even then they can only get a dozen or so runs per night In other words it s a huge system Replicating something even close to that will not be an easy task That being said I think there are related applications that we could look into Since I ve already promised the RAC group and the weather desk s PJM traders to put together a Vector AutoRegressive model of daily temperatures I think it makes sense to see if something better than a VAR model can be put together perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model Christian has What I have in mind is something that would give us say up to several dozens of possible temperature forecasts every morning which would be calculated using actual climate models as opposed to time series models I would not use this as a forecasting tool the NWS model results would make a far better best guess but our ensemble could still be used to provide a distribution of temperature scenarios This ensemble would have several uses 1 we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a more realistic daily V R for the Weather Book and eventually interface that with the power desk s V R calculations 2 we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to week ahead CDD and HDD distributions for use in our demand swaps 3 if Freese Notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts e g expect the trough to recede we could sort through the different Monte Carlo scenarions find one in which the trough in question is receding and use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures corresponding to that scenario Up till now we haven t found a good way of getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean temperature wise 4 we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns The traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating month ahead or season ahead weather trust me on this we could still use the visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations Just today I ve spoken with Dr Jacobsen of Stanford University who has written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting and who worked with UCLA s general circulation model He says that getting a simplified version of MM5 which is itself a simplified limited area version of the GCM models that NWS COLA and UCLA use would take several months to implement assuming the people involved are already well versed in the technology Also I have contacted AER a Massachusetts based weather consulting firm and they tell me that they have a MM5 model running daily only one run per night and also some smaller PC models up and running They are of course willing to work with us for a fee Their MM5 version runs on a 200 000 parallel processor I am open to your suggestions or objections as the case may be I m not sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of Enron and not just the weather desk I am scheduled to go to Boston next week anyway and would like to use the opportunity to visit with AER I will of course coordinate any projects with Christian if we get something like this up and running it will be more likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own Australian model Joe ","received_time":"2000-08-08

Tomlinson ENRON DEVELOPMENT 07 24 2000 06 00 PM To Vince J Kaminski ECT cc Subject Outage Tracker Option And Background Vince To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along with relative network performance from a few points I am currently chasing NEMMCO AU system operator to get hold of a few weeks of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas The idea follows along the lines literally that when a unit fails it will introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency which is then reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators The drop in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may change the phase shift across the whole grid The phase shift across the network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion devices switching on and off however a unit failure may be distinct The second option relates to how a unit fails whereby if a circuit breaker is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns then the outage will cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network Transformers will attenuate the pulse however it should be detectable many miles away from the fault location Measure the arrival time at several point on the network work out the shift and backtrack on the network Part of the solution is already proven in lightning trackers The solution may be made more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed i e measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a DSP This solution is more complex however this should allow unit failure to be pinpointed to a station The timing base for each of the nodes may be sourced from GPS timing self locating at the same time Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups Karl ","received_time":"2000-08-07

are well We spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and 20 you kindly offered that you would provide this Is this still possible We 20 realise that you are extremely busy so Chris and Les went ahead and wrote 20 something which is below and if you want to review change or re write t he 20 preface that would be very appreciated Let me know what your thoughts a re Thanks Julie we re getting close 20 Preface One of our main objectives in writing Energy Derivatives Pricing and Risk 20 Management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches fo r 20 the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss 20 in depth the models and to show how they relate to each other In this 20 way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wid e 20 range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which use s 20 a consistent modelling framework We believe that for practitioners this 20 last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and 20 presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving 20 arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad hoc and inconsiste nt 20 models for different instruments and markets see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE 20 CONSISTENT MODELS However it is not our wish to concentrate on one 20 particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we 20 believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probab ly 20 be clear from our discussions the model s we prefer We therefore try a nd 20 give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al l 20 the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models 20 which best suit their needs In order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters In 20 chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to mode l 20 and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book 20 In addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the Black Scholes 20 modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees 20 and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used througho ut 20 the book In Chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices As well as 20 analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that 20 can be used to model the prices We look at the well know process of 20 Geometric Brownian Motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility 20 and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated 20 and their parameters estimated Chapter 3 written by Vince Kaminski Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of 20 Enron Corp discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets 20 This chapter builds on the previous one It examines in detail the methods 20 merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different 20 pricing models introduced in chapter 2 Examples from crude gas and 20 electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretativ e 20 aspects of calculating volatility Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets Although such 20 curves are well understood and straight forward in the most financial 20 markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel l 20 defined curves In this chapter we describe forward price bounds for ener gy 20 prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments We 20 outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building 20 forward curves in energy markets the arbitrage approach the econometric 20 approach and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti c 20 factors Chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivativ e 20 markets and discusses their uses Examples of products analysed in this 20 chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as 20 energy swaptions compound options Asian options barrier options lookba ck 20 options and ladder options Chapter 6 investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot 20 price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives Closed form 20 solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and European option 20 prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the 20 models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience 20 yield and interest rate model Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style option s 20 can be evaluated for the models in Chapter 6 Simulation schemes are 20 developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a 20 variety of path dependent options In order to price options which 20 incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is 20 developed This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward 20 curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard European and 20 American style options Chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on 20 modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve The approach 20 results in a multi factor model that is able to realistically capture the 20 evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves The user defined 20 volatility structures can be of an extremely general form Closed form 20 solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficie nt 20 Monte Carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options The chapter 20 closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions 20 In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions 20 that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the 20 problem of managing the risk through time We begin with delta hedging a 20 portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging 01 20 illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models The 20 general model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi factor 20 hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed Chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of Value at Risk VaR 20 applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products After 20 discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs 20 volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated We then 20 compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR Delta Delta gamm a 20 historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation applying each to the sam e 20 portfolio of energy options In this chapter we also look at testing the 20 VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables Finally in Chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk We 20 look in detail at two quite different approaches CreditMetrics J P Morg an 20 1997 and CreditRisk Credit Suisse Financial Products 1997 for whi ch 20 detailed information is publicly available Together these provide an 20 extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk We present 20 numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives Before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this 20 book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o f 20 how both the 01 tool 01 and the market works The techniques we descri be are 20 certainly not 01 magic wands 018 which can be waved at data and risk mana gement 20 problems to provide instant and perfect solutions To quote from the 20 RiskMetrics Technical Document 01 01 no amount of sophisticated analyti cs will 20 replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk 018 How ever 20 the right tools correctly used make the job a lot easier ","received_time":"2000-08-02

to be an interesting and informative segment Congress passed the EEA in 1996 and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects uses and protects valued information In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA Dan Waltz will include hypothetical corporate case studies some actually torn from the headlines to illustrate his points This event is sponsored by ENA s Competitive Analysis and Business Controls CABC group and is supported by ENA legal This event kicks off CABC s Competitive Intelligence Standards Program which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron s practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA s legal guidelines as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron s own proprietary information I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation and we are inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects of serious competitive intelligence Select executives like yourselves are being invited to attend and I would welcome any suggestions of others that you think might benefit from attending this event The EEA presentation is set for August 15 1 30 3 00 PM in the 50th floor Conference room Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell Hope to see you there P

think help you better understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future When might be a good time to contact you by

need to do 1 you need to get a Unix password if you don t already have one your user id will be the same as on the NT network but a different password is issued 2 you need a program called Exceed on your PC request it from IT you already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform 3 you need an ftp program on your PC you can go to www download com and download one i like wsftp 4 Exceed is funny in the way it runs When you invoke Exceed or LIM Advanced User under Infobases if you already have this it will install itself the first time and will then disappear to the Taskbar you need to right click on the taskbar on Exceed and then choose Tools and Client Startup and then New You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow emulation You need to specify the Host Type as Sun enter your User Name and Password set the Host Name to capers ect enron com and then on the Command Line type the following carefully usr openwin bin xterm display D Then use the file menu to Save this as capers xs and then click on the Run menu within a second or two a window will open up with you logged into the serve capers You are now on a Unix server and the directory is your home directory From here if you simply type sas the 3 windows for an interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop You are in business 5 you also need to install your ftp follow the procedures with the software and then create a new session called enron where you choose as the server simply earth do not add any further descriptors such as enron com supply your user name and unix password check the remember password box and the default communication setups should be correct eg host type as automatic detect when you invoke ftp and connect to enron it will put you in your home directory on the Unix system the same directory your xwindow comes up in under Exceed if you have any problems i ll be happy to help Clayton PS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you ll just write your name down when you take them ","received_time":"2000-07-27

quickly to multiple inquiries in both locations Cantekin and Kirstee please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs 2 It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated positions and

liquidity risk resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the underlying positions b We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating the position numbers i e look into the details of specific transactions From what I know MG has a fairly rudimentary risk management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option prices and deltas They get some

Shanbhogue HOU ECT ECT cc Vince J Kaminski HOU ECT ECT Subject status Vasant I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home and are rested and recovered from the long flight back I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project the Gas Model and of my intentions here at Enron Software in compiled C on the Unix platform has been developed and debugged to listen to the EOL trades process them book them and file them away In addition software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis IT has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS for which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data I am in the process of documenting all of this for you With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq Dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq to see if the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq I have been researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell The new machine will be here any day now no financial obligation to anyone and I will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is Compaq specific I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you I ve tried to do my best for you Vasant but I have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here Just the other day SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there wasn t enough free space on the server s hard drive for the workfiles In discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading people whom I have known for over 10 years they indicated they were ubiquitous here The power traders have similar PC s to my new one and they have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones Also there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this When I have been told of tools available for real time data harvesting my requests for such have typically been met with well we have it but we haven t really tested it yet An example is the weather we still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES satellite My interests here are to help Enron to do well because I will do well only if Enron does well These aren t empty words my IRA is 100 invested in the Enron stock fund I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling and the difficulty working in the Research Group in terms of systems development is that frankly few people at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems We aren t directly generating revenues for Enron and we aren t really their customers except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses As it happens Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting person and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job reporting to George Hopley It is a wonderful opportunity for me Vasant as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders access to real time fundamentals data I was completely candid with Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research I told him you were disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines They also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year and thus may only bid on a job with your permission We agree the move is good for Enron we all work for Enron and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it They are comfortable with me they have known me for years as a hard worker honest and unpretensive They have already ordered a state of the art Unix workstation and server for me and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful including hiring an Analyst to work for me And I have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I have learned here So I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening It would be a lateral move in position and salary and I would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL database I will continue to work on their improvement and complete their documentation As it happens I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday and will be back Wednesday I had wanted

advanced books and papers The book has an endorsement by Jeff Skilling on the cover page The Research Group offered several one day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall The first part of the seminar about 4 hours in the morning covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business The second more technical afternoon session covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas fired power plants The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty Nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several in most cases arbitrary scenarios most likely optimistic pessimistic These scenarios don t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don t specify the future proactive management decisions The real option approach is very powerful because it allows to 1 capture uncertainty in an explicit way and 2 to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions Forward looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world The real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way I have seen in my career almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers The challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models It is especially critical to stress test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand Enron

taxes on your option income it s treated as ordinary income The tax is 28 x 30 000 8 400 You can use only 3 000 of your loss against ordinary income This saves you only 840 in taxes Of course if you have capital gains you can use losses on your option position as an offset The remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time less the time value of

explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity However after taking Vince s comments on the ordinary income capital loss TAX offsetting issue I think this is not a good article anymore I guess I could just throw this article away chonawee Short selling is better than exercising your employee stock options In general the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low In fact when exercising the options you are speculating that ENE would never reach this point plus interest again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company If you do not anticipate that you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise However if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak Then instead of exercising the options you should short sell or sell the stocks in that amount After short selling when you feel that the stock starts to go up you can buy them back to cover make profit and still keep the options On the other hand if the stock does not go down as expect you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes no dividends and zero risk free rate Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as follow If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70 you would earn 70 45 100 2 500 But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70 no matter how much ENE is in the future you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn 70 45 100 2 500 The advantage of short selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60 At this point you can cover your short position get 70 60 100 1 000 and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain 2 500 That is you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short sell In conclusion the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position ","received_time":"2000-07-11

short sell 100 ENE at 70 no matter how much ENE is in the future you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn 70 45 100 2 500 The advantage of short selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60 At this point you can cover your short position get 70 60 100 1 000 and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain 2 500 That is you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short sell In conclusion the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position ","received_time":"2000-07-10

finance department at LSU will be sending out financial award letters to new Ph D students before long and my interning at Enron would free up some additional departmental funds In addition If I will be here in Baton Rouge during the fall I will need to pay my tuition next month I am able to pursue an internship in large part because of the department s cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and or teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph D I have been told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU so I am trying to rock the boat as little as possible I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship I say internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my stipend while I am away is not assured until an offer has been extended by Enron I understand that there are procedures and protocols that must be followed before this occurs and I would be willing to do whatever is necessary to move to the next step in that process I will be in Houston on July 8 9 for my wife s grandmother s 80th birthday If it would be convenient I could be in town on the preceding Friday or following Monday for a

mix reshaping energy market Purchase of MG only a start in building B2B platforms writes Hillary Durgin 99 match Financial Times 16 Jun 2000 12 00 00 am 604 words By HILLARY DURGIN If Jeffrey Skilling is right Enron s acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg Enron s president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the Houston energy company aimed at making it a dominant new economy player across various industrial markets The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG the UK based metals trader is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated new investments the company is targeting It is seeking vehicles on which to build business to business B2B platforms in sectors such as logistics chemicals agricultural products and pulp paper Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets He argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal B2B sites for those sectors but reshape those industries As an example he points to Enron s new e commerce platform EnronOnline which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales The company the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power saw wholesale physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter Critics argue that Enron s move away from its familiar energy business into new industries where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched is risky Yet a number of industry analysts point out Enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the UK the largest trader of gas and power in the US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth It s a prudent strategy but it s got to be done in an orderly way says Ronald Barone analyst with Paine Webber in New York What they re doing here is what they ve been incredibly successful at doing he adds noting that Enron posted Dollars 1 3bn in earnings before interest and taxes ebit from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999 up 34 per cent from the previous year Earnings from that division accounted for two thirds of the company s overall income before interest and taxes last year and Mr Barone sees the unit s ebit increasing 15 30 per cent annually over several years As with gas and power and now broadband where Enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant risk management and financial services over the internet We will provide electronic commerce but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement or fulfilment of that contract Mr Skilling says That is an extremely powerful model If you look at other B2B sites they don t do that Mr Skilling argues Enron s e commerce platform will triumph over the other bulletin board type exchanges where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing price credit and fulfilment Not everyone shares that view Some energy companies for example would rather not do business with a competitor BP Amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies a Houston based neutral wholesale energy exchange With Koch Industries and American Electric Power it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals Enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets In acquiring MG Enron got a stable of warehouses lending it a strong physical position It should provide MG with a more vibrant more active physical spot market in more markets in the world says Greg Whalley chief executive officer of Enron Net Works the new division Enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets He argues that in metals and other markets Enron will deliver better pricing price risk management services cross commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry If you can take that platform and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to the table e commerce the industry and change the structure

02:25:00-07:00","message_body":"John I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination of risks through hedges as correctly pointed out in other messages Being aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it Now a few more detailed comments 1 I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate Illiquidity discount in my view should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth One should apply a haircut if liquidating a position takes a long time The approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physical assets which are by definition illiquid This illiquidity is recognized through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case we should be consistent and use this approach across the board for all project finance type cases not that I recommend this course of action 2 Valuation of an unheadgable options Let s look at it from the position of a seller of the option He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black Scholes valuation becomes the floor for the valuation the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk as opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges The issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors 1 risk preference 2 existing portfolio positions Risk preference Insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts expected loss unexpected loss The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 standard deviations The number of standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss I admit that it is a bit fuzzy but this is the way the world works We looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more about it Existing portfolio positions An additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk given all our positions in this region What are the practical implications Pricing depends on risk appetite the utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon and becomes to some degree arbitrary If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option that is greater than the Black Scholes value If we don t price this option explicitly the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium In the case of an option buyer the situation is reversed If he cannot hedge he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option How big is the discount See the comments above In the special case where hedging is possible and the Black Scholes Merton paradigm applies both values will become equal ignoring transaction costs The values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge 3 What happens in case we use simulation technology We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario each scenario will recognize the downside and or upside at different points in time in different states of the world If we run a sufficient number of scenarios we shall get a distribution of NPV as of today Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk but in most cases we are still holding it The expected value should be therefore adjusted for risk This is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium I hope this helps Please call me with additional questions Sorry for a delay in responding to this question I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant to make sure we all agree It s a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not have good answers Vince","received_time":"2000-06-26

discovery is poor and it s difficult to model the price curves independently we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves We have agreed on the following 1 Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic core curves He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run 2 The curves associated with the biggest 10 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves i e no

Sherriff LON ECT ECT Dale Surbey LON ECT ECT Subject Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey Vince John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting and potentially contentious option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in London We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which is currently seeking to IPO The issue we are discussing with RAC is which discount rate i e risk free and if so Turkish or US should we use to value these options First some additional information Option characteristics 116 000 options representing 9 of the company Term minimum of 3 years but possibly longer still being renegotiated Strike price 20 below the upcoming IPO price either priced in US or Turkish Lire We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of 118 75 per option but 34 800 expire on July 15 2000 with the remainder expiring on December 15 2000 The company s investment bankers ABN AMRO Rothchilds are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx 300 million Due to such a large valuation gap they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of June IPO target date in late Sept early Oct Our counter proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options We are arguing that the US risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company s historical senior debt cost 18 is the more appropriate number to use although admit that this is not justifiable only a proxy A few key points RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years i e for Black Scholes a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation The model simulates both an IPO no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 return The model assigns a 30 illiquidity discount In the simulated cases where the options are out of the money we obviously do not exercise We understand that for Black Scholes option valuation one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold And here is where we reach our difficulty since the company doesn t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities RAC is arguing that a US risk free is not appropriate to use Our argument is that the non IPO scenario a 30 illiquidity discount and a US based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation As such we feel RAC s approach is double counting If you managed to get through the above your a patient man I ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ve had a chance to digest the information Regards John Bottomley ","received_time":"2000-06-21

Kaminski You probably won t remember my name but I am the Ph D student that took you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State University during the previous academic year I received my M S in Finance in May of last year and chose to remain at LSU to work on my Ph D At that time I intended to pursue a career in teaching and research at a four year college or university In part because of your visit and my primary interest in normative research my plans have changed While I still want to earn my Ph D I plan to pursue a career in research in the private sector As you know Ph D programs in financial economics are designed to train future academics Not surprisingly they emphasize methods to approach the types of questions that are of interest to finance academics What did surprise me however was that these areas of interest often had little to do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners in the real world As you mentioned in your discussion academic researchers know little about what their counterparts in the private sector are doing In light of my objective I feel I would get the most out of the remainder of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the private sector to see first hand the types of challenges I can expect to face as a researcher in corporate America As my primary interests revolve around the use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk management Enron as the leading innovator in these areas would be an ideal place to learn I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the company that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for If there are no such positions or opportunities any advice or suggestions you could give me such as whether or not you think such a sabbatical for lack of a better term would be helpful or information on private sector careers for Ph D s would be greatly appreciated I am sending a current copy of my vita as an attachment If you have any

Turkey Vince John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting and potentially contentious option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in London We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which is currently seeking to IPO The issue we are discussing with RAC is which discount rate i e risk free and if so Turkish or US should we use to value these options First some additional information Option characteristics 116 000 options representing 9 of the company Term minimum of 3 years but possibly longer still being renegotiated Strike price 20 below the upcoming IPO price either priced in US or Turkish Lire We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of 118 75 per option but 34 800 expire on July 15 2000 with the remainder expiring on December 15 2000 The company s investment bankers ABN AMRO Rothchilds are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx 300 million Due to such a large valuation gap they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of June IPO target date in late Sept early Oct Our counter proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options We are arguing that the US risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company s historical senior debt cost 18 is the more appropriate number to use although admit that this is not justifiable only a proxy A few key points RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years i e for Black Scholes a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation The model simulates both an IPO no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 return The model assigns a 30 illiquidity discount In the simulated cases where the options are out of the money we obviously do not exercise We understand that for Black Scholes option valuation one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold And here is where we reach our difficulty since the company doesn t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities RAC is arguing that a US risk free is not appropriate to use Our argument is that the non IPO scenario a 30 illiquidity discount and a US based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation As such we feel RAC s approach is double counting If you managed to get through the above your a patient man I ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ve had a chance to digest the information Regards John Bottomley ","received_time":"2000-06-19 02:45:00-07:00","sender_address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","email_attachment":null,"message_subject":"Re:

out Steven Superior No controversy here Steve received consistently strong feedback ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories The only rough spot was teamwork arising from the friction

a timely manner and communication have improved I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on this feedback even though in terms of leadership I don t rate him high enough to run the group here Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjam s performance Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract from his overall performance On a related topic Anjam has been taking random days off typically on short notice so I suspect he s interviewing for a new job Given his inability to work with Steven especially in the future when Stephen heads the group this may be the best long term solution Any thoughts Ben Superior Another non controversial ranking Ben received consistently high marks from all the groups he supports especially in the area of non technical skills I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist Even though he was promoted at year end he s taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee and helping manage the other quant resources in Brian s group Also since Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben a mid year promotion is appropriate since he s effectively her supervisor Kirstee Strong Only limited feedback

06 12 2000 05 50 AM To Vince J Kaminski HOU ECT ECT cc Bryan Seyfried LON ECT ECT Subject INSEAD High tech Acquisitions Workshop Vince I attended the Workshop on High tech acquisitions at Insead on Saturday alongside participants from Cisco EADS Razorfish and Cable Wireless and academics from Insead and Wharton The basic premise was to discuss and get feedback from practitioners about the Research Project and a PhD study which is currently underway at Wharton The discussions were very interesting especially as this was my first exposure to this area Examples of the discussions raised include why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in house what degree of post acquisition integration was optimal difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro Asian high tech companies how to value small high tech firms how to quantify the success failure of an acquisition My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give us first hand access to the results Plus it would enable us to learn from the mistakes of others through meeting practitioners at such workshops and having greater access to the case studies I guess it could also aid our realignment within the high tech communication industry to be seen in such studies Regards Ben ","received_time":"2000-06-12

separate message about this visit will follow I would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships with different universities Historically we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions trying to hire the best students and limiting our presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions We should rethink the way we work with universities The efforts to get the best students look more and more like a hand to hand combat and often we are not very successful It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways 1 Involvement in research projects For example we are currently underwriting two research projects at Stanford University involving Ph D students of Professor Nicholas Bambos a top expert on communications networks We shall participate in formulation of the projects objectives and will be given access to the results Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and also to lock up some very promising students Most companies in the high tech industries have such programs 2 Lectures and presentations by Enron employees Practically every presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes and hiring decisions It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic program In many cases the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach them during their senior years 3 Visits by faculty members in Enron Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to getting the best students and obtaining access to current research The universities are very important in shaping public opinion on the issues critical to Enron s future especially in the area of deregulation and design of new markets Currently the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees In many cases there is no continuity and focus I want to recommend a creation of a special function VP or MD level responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities This function would be separate from our Analyst Associate program I have many ideas how this function could be structured

Krishnarao HOU ECT ECT cc vkaminski aol com Subject Book review Reviewed by Mark Williams SVP Risk Management Citizens Power The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived It has been four years since the first edition was published During this hiatus a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders practitioners and academics The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970 s and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters all of which include an introduction which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics highlighted panels detailed appendices and a separate glossary which provides the reader with additional reference material In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory pricing basis risk delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation For the more advanced reader the chapter on Energy Exotic Options written by Vince Kaminski Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments Additionally the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board s Statement 133 see EPRM October 1999 page 22 Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value The second edition however is not without flaws In particular it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments In the fledgling power market this continues to be one of the primary challenges In summary this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran It is a welcome edition to any risk management library ","received_time":"2000-05-22 02:33:00-07:00","sender_address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","email_attachment":null,"message_subject":"Re: Book

Energy Price Risk has finally arrived It has been four years since the first edition was published During this hiatus a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders practitioners and academics The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970 s and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters all of which include an introduction which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics highlighted panels detailed appendices and a separate glossary which provides the reader with additional reference material In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory pricing basis risk delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation For the more advanced reader the chapter on Energy Exotic Options written by Vince Kaminski Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments Additionally the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board s Statement 133 see EPRM October 1999 page 22 Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value The second edition however is not without flaws In particular it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments In the fledgling power market this continues to be one of the primary challenges In summary this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran It is a welcome edition to any risk management library ","received_time":"2000-05-16 05:48:00-07:00","sender_address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","email_attachment":null,"message_subject":"Book

have done for the LNG transactions 1 I was not involved in the LNG ship project I shall read the DASH and give you my comments Without looking at the details I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project please see point 2 2 Elba Island I am working with Doug Rotenberbg Brad Hitch Scott Earnest Sally Beck s organization and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron s LNG related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow Tuesday at 8 30 A few comments on the book design and my view of the project a The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long term contracts or became available due to some short term frictions The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long term contract prices The economics of the deal as represented by the book we are setting up will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US In other words we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction b The transaction will cover the period of 17 years with an extension option of 5 years Even if we can lock in the LNG volumes over this time period we have no ability to lock in the other side of the spread US gas prices for such a long tenor This is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG nat gas spread and I would not recommend locking in only one leg of the spread One solution would be to cover let s say 50 of he LNG volumes for the first 5 years and lock in the nat gas side on the US market side c The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG shipping rates schedules etc I would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market d My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal that are good for Enron and on the hedging strategy for the LNG

looking at the details I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project please see point 2 2 Elba Island I am working with Doug Rotenberbg Brad Hitch Scott Earnest Sally Beck s organization and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron s LNG related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow Tuesday at 8 30 A few comments on the book design and my view of the project a The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long term contracts or became available due to some short term frictions The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long term contract prices The economics of the deal as represented by the book we are setting up will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US In other words we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction b The transaction will cover the period of 17 years with an extension option of 5 years Even if we can lock in the LNG volumes over this time period we have no ability to lock in the other side of the spread US gas prices for such a long tenor This is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG nat gas spread and I would not recommend locking in only one leg of the spread One solution would be to cover let s say 50 of he LNG volumes for the first 5 years and lock in the nat gas side on the US market side c The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG shipping rates schedules etc I would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market d My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal that are good for Enron and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions Long term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with

technical level and otherwise I promised to send you an e mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer Let s see if we can get a match with your schedule mine is rather terrible Friday 21st of April looks good But April 23rd is Easter Sunday so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around Let me know if that is the case I am willing to visit then because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays Friday 19th of May is the next possibility but this probably is too far out The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research This window closes by the end of April and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford If so doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling then we can schedule it in May I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going

19 or Friday May 26 By the end of April I was able to attract a top new student to work on the project The other one for the coming year will be Giuseppe By spending the summer at Enron he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and create an intellectual team here at Stanford to look at these problems I must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going Talk to

Subject Visit to Enron Hello Vince It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch we had together I really enjoyed our discussions both at the technical level and otherwise I promised to send you an e mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer Let s see if we can get a match with your schedule mine is rather terrible Friday 21st of April looks good But April 23rd is Easter Sunday so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around Let me know if that is the case I am willing to visit then because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays Friday 19th of May is the next possibility but this probably is too far out The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research This window closes by the end of April and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford If so doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling then we can schedule it in May I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going Please let me know what you think Best

values for companies in the new economy takes more than a grasp of mathematics a dash of economics politics and logic would not go amiss says John Kay 87 match Financial Times 24 Apr 2000 12 00 00 am 1170 words Do the math The slogan favoured by Jim Clark creator of Silicon Graphics Net scape and Healtheon has become the mantra of a generation of consultants and investment bankers The new economy they claim requires new principles of valuation C com is one of the most exciting prospects in business to business commerce It is the world leader in a growing market annual sales by 2010 are likely to be Dollars 500 000bn If C com can maintain a 5 per cent share and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be Dollars 250bn If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future revenues at 10 per cent the prospective value of C com is Dollars 5 000bn about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of Microsoft Cisco or General Electric You don t have to wait for the IPO You can buy shares in C com right now for less than 5 per cent of that value C com is called Citigroup and in addition to its foreign exchange trading which is the business I have described you get its other wholesale retail and investment banking activities and a leading insurance company thrown in Of course nobody would be so stupid as to value Citigroup in this way Yet I have followed more or less exactly the methodology recommended in the latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era companies They use precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation of Dollars 37bn for Amazon com Paul Gibbs head of merger and acquisition research at J P Morgan recently used similar principles to confirm that assessment of Amazon He then performed the same calculation for internet service provider Freeserve Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year that 25 per cent of sales take place on the net that portals capture 50 per cent of these that Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and maintains an 8 per cent commission on sales Multiply these together and you establish that in 2017 Freeserve will make profits of o2bn Dollars 3 2bn This he argues justifies a value today of o6 50 per share But I prefer T com to Freeserve T com has a customer base four times larger than Freeserve Its franchise is stronger Its customers are concentrated in the affluent south east of England where it faces virtually no competition Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its customers use its essential services every day many of them several times a day T com also has ambitious plans for expansion At present its geographical coverage is less than one quarter of the market in England and Wales T com has an interest in south east Asia The population of China is 100 times the number of people who today can access T com services Even after the recent market correction T com better known as Thames Water still has a market valuation below that of Freeserve At the widest point between the old and new economies Freeserve was worth four times as much The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is simple but fundamental The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary widely If you buy small quantities of notes from a bank the spread is much wider than 1 per cent If you are a large corporation trading major currencies the margin is wafer thin Entry and competition force prices down to the related costs In Mr Gibbs s model Freeserve earns profits of o2bn about equal to the current profits of Tesco J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer together And it earns these on revenues of only o2 5bn so that profits are 80 per cent of the value of its sales No established business earns margins of that size Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose market position is so strong whose output is so necessary to life that if it charged five times the current price we would have little choice but to pay We do have one option to insist the government intervenes It confines Thames Water to a return on its capital employed of about 6 per cent The idea that profit is a return on capital invested still has some role in new economy valuation at the level of the overall market There is a key formula in the new math The required yield on a security is equal to the difference between the rate of return demanded from that class of securities and its expected rate of growth So if you expect a return of 5 5 per cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per cent calculations show that the dividend yield should be 0 5 per cent This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett in their book Dow 36 000 Claiming that sustainable dividends average half of earnings this yield equates to a price earnings ratio of 100 implying a target of 36 000 for the US index The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to produce what the investor is looking for Investors will receive only two fifths of the cash sustaining the valuation this century One third of the total depends on dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200 Two hundred years ago well before the Dow Jones average prudent diversified investors would have owned slave traders and sugar plantations or perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new economy a canal The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and Microsoft and Cisco may prove more enduring than plantations But we can hardly be sure While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the growth rate of dividends in the US economy as a whole it is likely that well before 2200 most of these will come from companies not yet founded Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett s protests that their dividend growth expectations are conservative If you raise them only from 5 per cent to 5 25 per cent the anticipated value of the Dow Jones average is 72 000 At 5 5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares of US companies are infinitely valuable Not even the most credulous dotcom investor believes that The math also works in reverse If expectations of return are 6 per cent rather than 5 5 per cent the market p e ratio falls to 50 and the value of the Dow Jones from 36 000 to 18 000 And if equity investors require a return of 8 per cent you would have to conclude that shares are worth only half their current level An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for an equity investor A day trader might think you were talking about a weekly profit rather than annual Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5 5 per cent the return on Treasury bonds because they argue that equities have so consistently outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated with equity investment In other words because equities are sure to offer higher returns than bonds the expected yield on equities should be the same as on bonds You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw The rules of logic hold even in cyberspace and so do the principles of economics Profits are hard to earn in competitive businesses and markets that are not competitive are usually regulated The value of companies ultimately depends on their capacity to generate cash for shareholders Distant returns are uncertain Share prices are volatile and investors need to be compensated for the risks These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old By all means do the math Isaac Newton who could do the math better than most gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in the South Sea Bubble In addition to the math you need the econ the pol and perhaps the psychology Dow 36 000 The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market James K Glassman Kevin A Hassett

employment He is currently an assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member of our department We hate to lose him however his interest has shifted from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application and development of statistical methodologies including stochastic modeling Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph D program he was in the same group of students as Martin Lawera Keith spent several years at Los Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice He has been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation and that of my

to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a result of Prof Lane Hughston s recommendation Lane is an acquaintance of Vince and me and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was too old and too experienced Since I felt that Thomas has some merit I asked Houston to have an informal chat with Thomas Houston wish to pursue the interview process further and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews I m somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this since it seems he s trying to put up barriers to these interviews I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he recounts some strange conversations with Anjam He says he received a call from Anjam on Thursday 13th April evening outside office hours asking how he got his CV into Enron I d shown Anjam the email and CV back in early February and how Anjam could contact him despite the fact he was contacting him at that moment Anjam then called Thomas on his work number bad form on Friday 14th asking Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday one working day s notice Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week and that he d have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things at work He said he d contact Anjam on Monday today to confirm his availability Today 17th April Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn t make it and that he wouldn t be able to make it for two weeks not so serious he thought given that we re losing time to Easter anyway Anjam told Thomas that the position might be filled in two weeks time Thomas is concerned about missing the boat and I for one didn t even realise it was leaving so soon Can anyone shed any light on this Steve

during Risk2000 in Boston on 13 14 June Although I would welcome suggestions to the contrary I would prefer to go straight into the discussion rather than have a series of short presentations first Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic areas around which the moderator can lead the discussion naturally for the better discussions it s important to have varying views on similar subjects similarly it is often interesting to hear the panel s comments on one individual s more specific area of knowledge Conseqently if you could return this email to all panel members with topics you feel should be covered any particular areas you would personally like to focus on any proposed changes to the actual panel structure and possibly additonal panel members you think should be there that would be a good start I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if anyone has any suggestions please let me know The talk title is Effectively Applying Weather Derivatives Best

summer and get my mandatory military duty done However I now realize I can put it off to a further date That left me wondering if you believe there is a project that I can get involved in this summer

intitial credit meeting they still had questions primarily related to our control of market and credit risk To that end Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick Buy Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody s team The questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses We discussed VAR stress testing and potential credit exposure To make a long story short subsequent to that meeting they reconvened their committee and announced the upgrade I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and will continue to be as the bar gets raised I am sure that next year they will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well as extensions of our current platform tail risk intra day risk operational risk and

broader than his investment banking quant experience He remains interested and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders but wants to look at new markets and products I think we should seriously consider hiring him He is understandably reluctant to move to Houston but there s no doubt that there is plenty of unnmet demand for derivatives pricing and thinking here in London Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him I m meeting with him again on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised

a step farther by making this next session a more technically oriented meeting There are two spots you may wish to consider 1 The session entitled Case Study in Modeling Volatility scheduled for Wednesday May 10th from 3 30 to 5 00 pm You will note below what we had in mind for the case study 2 The talk A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation scheduled for Thursday May 11th from 10 30 am

optional Model should be for a particular purpose Examples valuing a new combustion turbine at the Florida Georgia border bidding on a portfolio of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL valuing a retail portfolio in Pennsylvania 2 Model should be estimated on a particular data set Examples daily NYMEX close prices for Palo Verde PJM hourly spot prices for 1998 1999 3 Case study should describe several candidate models for volatility and or market price that were considered Case study should discuss why these models were considered Candidate models should be described mathematically and verbally 4 Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly identified and quantified to the extent possible Examples of evaluation criteria residuals that are not autorcorrelated stationarity R squared Akaike information criterion 5 Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed The estimation procedure employed should be briefly described 6 Some diagnostics of model fit vis a vis data set should be presented 7 If possible predictive power of model should be assessed Generally the case study should include all of the items above The case

Scientific Word DVI file at the weekend if you can read SCientific Word files The dissertation hasn t been reviewed by Les or the External yet although its been at FORC for 2 months I think that the Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our company s businesses although I ultimately didn t have the time to explicitly price the jump risk premium which I conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange traded electricity futures options rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment with a little bit of further work but not too much be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets In other words I assumed spot jump risk to be undiversifiable and essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to 1 proving that a jump diffusion trading model is incomplete synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with term structure securities as in the HJM w jumps papers of Shirakawa and Das and 2 deriving an explicit risk adjustment process for implementing the price of jump risk using a jump diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process ie a jump augmented production economy approach in the spirit of CIR Bates Ahn Thompson Incidentally I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done much work on real asset valuations in a spark spread option valuation framework I m about to start a project evaluation of embedded optionality and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward gas power price processes With the former I can model mean reversion and jumps explicitly obviously important for capturing the optionality of out of the money plant which might otherwise be ignored in a pure diffusion framework but am not maximising the informational content of the available market data that is assuming there was a long term market forward curve for electricity whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that I have to capture mean reversion via the futures volatility function and jumps are less easy to calibrate Any suggestions Regards Bernard ","received_time":"2001-03-01 01:36:00-08:00","sender_address":"vince.kaminski@enron.com","email_attachment":null,"message_subject":"RE: 1997 Risk paper on

another group which is something we re asked to do from time to time I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what it achieves with respect to its requirements what its shortfalls are and therefore what the risks associated with using this method are We cannot provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron which I feel falls firmly within RAC territory This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other groups after all To sign off means to accept something which our opinion in itself cannot do It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical note outlining the methodology risks and shortcomings of a method leaving the formal sign off to those best placed to assess these risks for our company The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view on what is acceptable risk for the company Steve ","received_time":"2001-01-24

Recipient list suppressed cc Subject Liz Demers research seminar Dear faculty Bob Westbrook and the accounting group has asked me to put together a continuing series of research workshops in accounting My intention is to invite four or five researchers from around the country to present workshops on topics of interest each year These are in addition to the normal recruiting seminars that we will have The researchers will be a combination of senior and junior researchers In addition to adding to our own research culture the seminars should help promote the Jones School in the academic accounting community My intention is to invite people that are doing very interesting work that will be of interest to a large portion of the faculty Given the small size of the accounting group success of the seminars is dependent in part on the participation of faculty from other disciplines Our first seminar will be on February 16 from 10 30 12 00 and will be conducted by Elizabeth Demers a Stanford PhD and presently an assistant professor at Rochester Her paper is titled A Rude Awakening Internet Shakeout in 2000 and co authored with Baruch Lev a senior accounting researcher at NYU The work should be of particular interest to faculty in Finance and those interested in the valuation of internet companies and the value of intellectual capital and non financial information I expect that it will be a very interesting seminar Liz will arrive Thursday late afternoon and be here all day on Friday I invite any of you who would like to meet with her or join us for a meal to please let me know I will appreciate it if you could plan on attending at least some of our seminars I hope that the topics and presenters will be of interest Thanks for your support Marc Marc J Epstein Jones

was having with John Goodpasture and you and he said either or both of you were the right people to continue after his responsibility shift John was quite positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that direction after he handed it to you Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys If so please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on my voicemail at 650 218 3069 I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested not to mention our power model The progress is noticeable since you saw it Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG North American LNG import terminals and term gas basis calculations trading support power plant development gas to power price spreads in key markets veracity of heat rate trades bank financings storage field evaluation and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again I think NARG can help you become even more successful and I look forward to working with you We

dictated by the limitations of the computer system we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory Also in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it s difficult to model the price curves independently we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves We have agreed on the following 1 Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic core curves He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run 2 The curves associated with the biggest 10 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves i e no mapping into other locations It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates 3 The results of an automated clustering mapping procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions This responsibility should be vested with one person right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible Research can allocate one person to this task cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical

Conference is already taking place I think it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round table discussion However I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion I ve been teaching a real options course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis Black Scholes pricing and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course However I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing trading and hedging with Excel VBA skills In fact he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations This is not to say that some of my other students aren t very talented themselves but that this person really stands out Do you think you and or Enron would be interested in such a person If so what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door His intention is to finish the MBA but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest

Enron Enron Subject Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis Hi Vince Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before lending more credibility in the Ag community The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A M Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep and the focus is primarily to get a non quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk The pilot program itself will be very small and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination Another thought on hedging our potential short positon on the origination side is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received we still have unlimited downside from the short Vasant p s I am writing up Jim Bouillion s project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton Of course we may still ask Wharton for their insights on the corn price

time for you guys If so please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on my voicemail at 650 218 3069 I think you will be truly impressed with the scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG and the long run NARG in which you were interested not to mention our power model The progress is noticeable since you saw it Both long and short term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG North American LNG import terminals and term gas basis calculations trading support power plant development gas to power price spreads in key markets veracity of heat rate trades bank financings storage field evaluation and which new pipelines we can expect to see enter and which are dogs I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually productive direction again I think NARG can help you become even more successful and I look forward to working with you We

invitation to the presentation only I didn t think any of them would be invited to the dinner and probably none will even come to the presentation The invitation did elicit one request for the final
