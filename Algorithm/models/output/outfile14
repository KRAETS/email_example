a new plan of attack for Schedule E s He informed me that the top levels were typically put in at one region level per roll I had Zhiyun re run the killed deals calc post id 15667 Everyone should go

pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots I have also identified where the 4 6 MM difference for OPPD arose from Deal 11678 04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book In addition there are no volumes in this deals however if you look back to the official 11 30 2001 calc there are volumes for this deal It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD 11678 4 and 564826 1 Deal 564826 1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately 4MM different I have printed detail for deals 11678 4 and 564826 1 they are in Casey s chair as of the 11 30 2001 official calc I have also printed deal 564826 1 in the 11 30 2001 bankruptcy calc I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc Please re calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing no one should be working or playing on anything other than

whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved because they were already liquidated in November Also I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations There is one counterparty TXU added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling Before recalcing the Bank portfolios please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis 4 2022 to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios We should still be calcing on No True up Casey I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble At this point we are going for reasonableness with numbers All the previous top levels in our rolls as of the 3rd or 4th will stay as top levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios we will not be flat Currently we are liquidating all non terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara The settlements group

potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility therefore no blending is needed for daily options they point directly to the daily vols or monthly options they point directly to the monthly vol All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly therefore blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options The best rules to be in place for the blending vs non blending would be based on curve East curves do not blend West curves do blend Therefore ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that for example the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region curve and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration We still need to discuss this I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the
