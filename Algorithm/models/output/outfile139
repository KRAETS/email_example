my Lord and Savior Jesus This is the letter that I spoke of that was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at my church She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much Like I breifly stated earlier I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families friends church government and even our enemies Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don t get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great We re all in this together if you hurt we hurt I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me this week For the past two months I have been going to the doctor because of a lump I found under my arm As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy I trust and believe that God will heal God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time my husband and I have reunited our family we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time however in the midst of those blessings the devil has gotten mad So he has decided to try and pull me down once again I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy God Bless Each of you and Season s Greetings Love Marylyn GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less Join Juno

Hey what do you think of this one I even thought we could give what ever ones you won t use for the church s programs on Sunday HOW DO YOU LIVE YOUR DASH I read of a man who stood to speak At the funeral of a friend He referred to the dates on her tombstone From the beginning to the end He noted that first came her date of birth And spoke the following date with tears But he said what mattered most of all Was the dash between those years l900 l970 For that dash represents all the time That she spent alive on earth And now only those who loved her Know what that little line is worth For it matters not how much we own The cars the house the cash What matters is how we live and love And how we spend our dash So think about this long and hard Are there things you d like to change For you never know how much time is left That can still be rearranged If we could just slow down enough To consider what s true and real And always try to understand The way other people feel And be less quick to anger And show appreciation more And love the people in our lives Like we ve never loved before If we treat each other with respect And more often wear a smile Remembering that this special dash Might only last a little while So when your eulogy s being read With your life s actions to rehash Would you be proud of the things they say About how you spent your dash Makes a lot of Sense Top

time I read it Once upon a time there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans He loved them but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him One day he met a girl and fell in love When it became apparent that they would marry he thought to himself she ll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans Shortly after that they were married A few months later on the way home from work his car broke down and since they lived in the country he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk On his way home he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home So he went in and ordered and before leaving he had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans All the way home he putt putted By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited She exclaimed Darling I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight She put a blindfold on him and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peak At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold the telephone rang She again made him promise not to peek until she returned and away she went to answer the phone While she was gone he seized the opportunity He shifter his weight to one leg and let it go It was not only loud but ripe as a rotten egg He had a hard time breathing so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him He had just started to feel better when another urge came on He raised his leg and RRIIIPPPP It sounded like a diesel engine revving and smelled worse To keep from gagging he tried fanning his arms awhile hoping the smell would dissipate He got another urge this was the real blue ribbon winner the windows shook the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead While keeping an ear turned in on the conversation in the hallway and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded he carried on like this for the next ten minutes farting and fanning each time with his napkin When he heard the phone farewells he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it Smiling contentedly he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in Apologizing for taking so long she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table After assuring her he had not peeked she removed the blindfold and yelled SURPRISE To his shock and horror there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise dinner party

bring chills Have you ever felt the urge to pray for someone and then just put it on a list and said I ll pray for them later Or has anyone ever called you and said I need you to pray for me I have this need Read the following story that was sent to me and may it change the way you think about prayer and also the way you pray You will be blessed by this A missionary on furlough told this true story while visiting his home church in Michigan While serving at a small field hospital in Africa every two weeks I traveled by bicycle through the jungle to a nearby city for supplies This was a journey of two days and required camping overnight at the halfway point On one of these journeys I arrived in the city where I planned to collect money from a bank purchase medicine and supplies and then begin my two day journey back to the field hospital Upon my arrival in the city I observed two men fighting one of whom had been seriously injured I treated him for his injuries and at the same time talked to him about the Lord I then traveled two days camping overnight and arrived home without incident Two weeks later I repeated my journey Upon arriving in the city I was approached by the young man I had treated He told me that he had known I carried money and medicines He said Some friends and I followed you into the jungle knowing you would camp overnight We planned to kill you and take your money and drugs but just as we were about to move into your camp we saw that you were surrounded by 26 armed guards At this I laughed and said that I was certainly all alone in that jungle campsite The young man pressed the point however and said No sir I was not the only person to see the guards My five friends also saw them and we all counted them It was because of those guards that we were afraid and left you alone At this point in the sermon one of the men in the congregation jumped to his feet and interrupted the missionary and asked if he could tell him the exact day this happened The missionary told the congregation the date and the man who had interrupted told him this story On the night of your incident in Africa it was morning here and I was preparing to go play golf I was about to putt when I felt the urge to pray for you In fact the urging of the Lord was so strong I called men in this church to meet with me here in the sanctuary to pray for you Would all of those men who met with me on that day stand up The men who had met to pray together that day stood up The missionary wasn t concerned with who they were he was too busy counting how many men he saw There were 26 This story is an incredible example of how the Spirit of the Lord moves in mysterious ways If you ever hear such prodding go along with it Nothing is ever hurt by prayer except the gates of hell I encourage you to forward this to as many people as you know If we all take it to heart we can turn this world toward God once again As the above true story clearly illustrates with God all things are possible and more importantly how God hears and answers the prayers of the faithful After you read this please pass it on and give God thanks for the beautiful gift of your faith for the powerful gift of prayer and for the many miracles He works in your daily life http profiles msn com

same message drink plenty of water All along most race courses are water stations and most runners slow down to drink a cup of cool water Keeping your water level up is critical when you run If you get slightly dehydrated you will not run well If you get moderately dehydrated you will become disoriented If you get seriously dehydrated you can die It s serious business The first year I ran was 1991 and I was inexperienced also younger slimmer stupider etc I passed water stop after water stop occasionally drinking a swallow or two I felt good and I wasn t going to waste precious seconds drinking water even though it was a hot humid day Big mistake As I neared the final mile I hit the wall My energy level dropped to zero I began having to walk some and I realized I would have to work hard just to finish I did make it across the line but only with a tremendous headache and hardly enough energy to walk It was not much fun I learned an important lesson that year Stopping for water doesn t actually slow you down In fact you will run a better race if you do drink water The bottom line is that your body is simply not designed to function without water In the same way your spiritual stamina depends on stopping for regular drinks of spiritual water The dilemma for busy believers is finding time to invest in reading the Word and meeting with God in prayer Like the runner intent on reaching the finish line we tend to put off those regular drinks of water until we are totally parched But in the long run you will run a better race if you will stop for spiritual water In fact finishing the Christian race at all may depend on it And runners who don t ever slow down to take a drink often stumble off the course far short of the finish line In this year s race I saw a man become dehydrated just a mile from the finish Strangely he didn t seem to recognize that anything was wrong He was swaying from side to side as he walked mumbling over and over I m fine I m fine He was so disoriented that he didn t even recognize his own sick condition If you let yourself become spiritually dehydrated you may not even be able to recognize it Stop today to drink some cool living water For serious runners it s a must Now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying If any man is thirsty let him come to Me and drink He who believes in Me as the Scripture said From his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water John 7 37 38 Don t forget to pass this on brought to you by Daily Blessings http www daily blessings com bless190p htm

and the only one who is will never make you cry If you love someone put their name in a circle instead of a heart because hearts can break but circles go on forever Friends listen to what you say Best friends listen to what you don t say If all my friends were to jump off a bridge I wouldn t jump with them I d be at the bottom to catch them Don t frown because you never know who s falling in love with your smile If you judge people you have no time to love them Mother Teresa Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle It takes a minute to have a crush on someone an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone Enthusiasm is contagious You could start an epidemic Yesterday is the past tomorrow is the future Today is a gift that is why we call it the present Send this to everyone you will never forget and send it back to the person who sent it to you too just to show them that you will never forget them If you don t send it back

been going to the doctor because of a lump I found under my arm As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast Both test came back abnormal and I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy I trust and believe that God will heal God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time my husband and I have reunited our family we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time however in the midst of those blessings the devil has gotten mad So he has decided to try and pull me down once again I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy God Bless Each
