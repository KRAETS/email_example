pretty cool This is just how I remember it Please show this to Kara I bet Mom can remember back ds Subject Re Remember REMEMBER When the worst thing you could do at school was smoke in the bathrooms flunk a test or chew gum And the banquets were in the cafeteria and we danced to a juke box later and all the girls wore fluffy pastel gowns and the boys wore suits for the first time and we were allowed to stay out till 12 p m When a 57 Chevy was everyone s dream car to cruise peel out lay rubber and watch drag races and people went steady and girls wore a class ring with an inch of wrapped dental floss or yarn coated with pastel frost nail polish so it would fit her finger And no one ever asked where the car keys were cause they were always in the car in the ignition and the doors were never locked And you got in big trouble if you accidentally locked the doors at home since no one ever had a key Remember lying on your back on the grass with your friends and saying things like That cloud looks like a And playing baseball with no adults to help kids with the rules of the game Back then baseball was not a psychological group learning experience it was a game Remember when stuff from the store came without safety caps and hermetic seals cause no one had yet tried to poison a perfect stranger And with all our progress don t you just wish just once you could slip back in time and savor the slower pace and share it with the children of the 80 s and 90 s So send this on to someone who can still remember Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys Laurel Hardy Howdy Doody and The Peanut Gallery The Lone Ranger The Shadow Knows Nellie Belle Roy and Dale Trigger and Buttermilk as well as the sound of a real mower on Saturday morning and summers filled with bike rides playing in cowboy land baseball games bowling and visits to the pool and eating Kool Aid powder with sugar When being sent to the principal s office was nothing compared to the fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home Basically we were in fear for our lives but it wasn t because of drive by shootings drugs gangs etc Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat But we all survived because their love was greater than the threat Didn t that feel good just to go back and say Yeah I remember that And was it really that long ago ","message_subject":"FW: [Fwd:

to accommodate program changes to the Unit Control program This outage also needs to include unloader inspection which means there will be substantial downtime of Unit 401during the day Do I need to provide other information because unloader inspection will be performed We found out last Thursday which unloaders were not functioning correctly I have asked Steve SanMiguel to circulate a memo

last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW s 7 of water They said it was more like drip This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen If I have the wrong impression on what is

Jolly ET S Enron ENRON Subject Re Pigging from P 2 to P 3 Randy I agree we should continue to pig the line until the liquids have been cleared out then pig it on a regular basis We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen Their may be days that it just does not work on one side or the other but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi weekly or monthly basis to make it happen We will work with you any way we can Also I m sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P 2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral Gary Randy LeBeau 06 12 2001 05 46 PM To Gary Spraggins ET S Enron ENRON cc Rich Jolly ET S Enron ENRON Subject Pigging from P 2 to P 3 Gary we recently had to run a pig from P 2 to P 3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line Apparently in order to run a pig some volume has to be routed to that line I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas This point feeds some domestic customers We don t want condensate getting into this point There is a customer on this line Owens Corning who gets fuel from us Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes At any given time I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production If they lose fuel the product is lost and we could be liable I am also told that once the plant goes down it could take a long time even weeks to get it back up The Owens Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel When the line has large amounts of condensate we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure The gas from Energas is NOT measured They used to have the contract but when we got it they removed their meter setting Apparently they agreed verbally to supply gas to the plant in March for a few hours when a pig was run The plant uses about 3 mmcf d and Energas was on for about 3 hours I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel 21 000 Obviously we will negotiate that amount but they have us at a disadvantage I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule we would not get large condensate amounts into P 3 which shuts us down by the way we would not have to use Energas we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point and we would not incur the overtime when this happens I m sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then depending on what we push into P 3 get on a regular schedule possibly once a month What do you think we can do to work something out Thanks for any help you can give

Griffith Power plant located off of TW s mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market Gas Control Issues Nominations Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements between Duke and PPL You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics Team Flows We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations We will watch the noms this week to get a feel of where and how much they may vary As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order If this looks like it is going to be small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 TW primary When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 El Paso primary and flow the gas until accumed and switch back to 1 TW primary If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the Site from Gas Control The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure problems Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens Please don t hesitate to call if you need help Thanks
