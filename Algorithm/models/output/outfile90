The economy is going to get crushed this year There s only one place to put one s money now and that is in cash The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs The Fed could continue to lower rates but there ll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up I feel we ve just seen the beginning I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April Psychologically the California crisis will add to consumer fear The crisis is not a short term problem As a result barring any Federal bailout you could kiss that state s economy goodbye Let me ask you a question if you were paying 1 the highest real estate prices in the country and 2 the highest energy prices for the least reliable power in 3 the midst of a hi tech meltdown what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state If you own any CA real estate sell The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply Since CA doesn t want any power plants in its backyard the supply issue likely won t be solved anytime soon So how do impact demand You have to price energy power gas so high that the discretionary user household manufacturer commercial store conserves by closing its plant cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off peak hours California will see this reduction in demand over time If the blackouts subside it s because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state Without this the blackouts will get much worse If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2 3 yrs Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U S s most prosperous state Obviously this is only my opinion but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets that s where the key to the turnaround lies Take Care

10 59PM Enron rating setup irks many workers By L M SIXEL TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp and it s not because of the bonuses they re expecting next month Employees are irate about a new performance review ranking system that pits them against each other Under the system nicknamed rank and yank employees will be put in one of five categories 5 percent will be identified as superior 30 percent will be labeled excellent 30 percent will be called strong 20 percent will be labeled satisfactory and 15 percent will be called needs improvement or issues An insider said needs improvement means you have one leg hanging out the window And issues is Enron lingo for you re gone The rankings whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up with are not based just on performance Instead they compare employee against employee It is possible therefore for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees performance raised the bar according to a memo from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month While employees are competing against each other for ratings they re also expected to be team players according to the memo Horse trading of rank denied The problem according to someone familiar with the new system is the horse trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up Managers trade rankings like baseball cards explained the insider offering to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another employee An employee s ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the manager he is working for the insider said Olson who s over human resources and community relations said no horsetrading is going on The rankings due out this week aren t set in stone she said Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior she said But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect of bargaining She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it s a new system for about 60 percent of Enron s employees In years past only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron which is known for hiring superstars apparently feels that it must get rid of so many employees or at least put them on notice that they re not doing well It doesn t say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you re getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year said a human resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous Some may not fit in Some people as smart and talented as they are just don t fit into Enron s culture Olson said It s a company that doesn t tell people what to do you have to know what adds value she said Some folks just have a hard time in that environment After thinking about it for a moment Olson added that maybe Enron s recruiters aren t doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn t do well in an entrepreneurial environment Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago But they fell out of favor in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation Several years ago Houston Lighting Power put in a forced ranking system dividing all employees into four groups with 1 the top group and 4 the lowest Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had T shirts printed Don t ask me I m a 3 Olson said she doesn t see a problem with motivation People like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category she said But many of the employees at least the ones who rate above satisfactory won t know how they re rated Managers don t have to reveal the ratings And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior You ve got to reinvent your job add new business lines or create something totally new Employees understand that

The economy is going to get crushed this year There s only one place to put one s money now and that is in cash The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in plant shutdowns and company layoffs The Fed could continue to lower rates but there ll be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up I feel we ve just seen the beginning I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April Psychologically the California crisis will add to consumer fear The crisis is not a short term problem As a result barring any Federal bailout you could kiss that state s economy goodbye Let me ask you a question if you were paying 1 the highest real estate prices in the country and 2 the highest energy prices for the least reliable power in 3 the midst of a hi tech meltdown what would keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state If you own any CA real estate sell The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply Since CA doesn t want any power plants in its backyard the supply issue likely won t be solved anytime soon So how do impact demand You have to price energy power gas so high that the discretionary user household manufacturer commercial store conserves by closing its plant cutting back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off peak hours California will see this reduction in demand over time If the blackouts subside it s because so many businesses have closed their doors for good or moved to another state Without this the blackouts will get much worse If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas I would bet it will go bankrupt within 2 3 yrs Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U S s most prosperous state Obviously this is only my opinion but I would keep my eyes on the energy markets that s where the key to the turnaround lies Take Care

companies start migrating to Texas Joking aside unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall you re summer will suck There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back However with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps this won t happen The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease The other factor of course is that you could have an increase in supply new power plants But being that the amt of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn t had a new power plant in the last 10 years an increase in supply doesn t seem likely in the short term Again this is only my

I couldn t even see Kendall I don t know if something happened with the translation of the file but try to send it again if you can In regards to California s energy crisis I think that California is screwed big time I think it has the potential to cripple the state s economy If like you said noone really talks about it much in SoCal I would bet that will change soon It has the potential to affect every person in the state Not only will consumers end up bailing out the utilities SoCal Edison San Diego Gas and Electric PG E but it will likely prevent many new companies from setting up shop in California After all who would want to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power interruptions while paying the highest utility bills in the country I think that the only way California will come out of this OK is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeable future I don t think this is a problem that will be resolved within the next couple years

companies start migrating to Texas Joking aside unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall you re summer will suck There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the problem is to reduce demand This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price sensitive buyers cut back However with your boy Grey Davis pushing for price caps this won t happen The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave so this will probably need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease The other factor of course is that you could have an increase in supply new power plants But being that the amt of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined with the fact that CA hasn t had a new power plant in the last 10 years an increase in supply doesn t seem likely in the short term Again this is only my

ve never seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team of course I m talking abt the Astros When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd your team is down by 1 run and there is 2 outs Answer NEVER According to Dierker the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second Dierker said We did that because Jeff Kent was 3 for 17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at bats against him so he showed some dominance against him Obviously you don t want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason and we did How s long s this clown been managing I guess he hasn t followed Kent the last few years It wasn t like he was walking Bonds to get to Ivan DeJesus He doesn t even have the sack to admit he fucked up I ve never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack Have you and Patty been getting any sleep How s Jack

of the most disappointing games i ve ever attended the astros don t even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play the manager s an idiot intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd with 2 outs Anyway in terms of the Miata the dealer recommended abt 1300 worth of work Of course i told him to just get the thing running 450 The problem is the blue book value is only 2500 so i can t see putting another grand into it I ll probably just sell it to someone who races miata s which is really big in Texas or donate it to charity and take the tax write off We haven t test driven anything yet but it looks like we re leaning toward the BMW 330i It seems to get great reviews the main downside is that it s a little small but still sporty We ll go for test drives this weekend and
