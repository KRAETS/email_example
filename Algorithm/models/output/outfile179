un buckling means a stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents b utilizing tho se receivables plus if

be enough to reinstat e the surety bond The Construction Services group employs approximately 2 600 people and is worth given current backlog between 100 and 125 mill ion dollars Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6 0 to 90 days and we control 100 of the stock of this company The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group also know as ServiceCo Again these companies largely operate independently of Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron Currently we have o utside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups th at
