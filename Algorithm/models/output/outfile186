scheduler with Texas experience Mike took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline Waha scheduling He trained our new hire Jay Smith and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the Katy Hub Prior to the sale of HPL all of our activity a t the Katy hub passed through the pipeline Mike used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effecti vely schedule our transactions Since June Mike has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes Westar HPL PGE Channel Oasi s Guadalupe Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over 30 000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November In July I began tr acking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees t hrough the hub Mike used his knowledge of the pipes his business relati onships and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we s cheduled under our contracts In essence I kept a sort of P L for him M ike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself as if this were his business With the limited number of people on our desk I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading Truthfully I spent the majority o f my time with the trading Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilit ies He acted as lead supervising and training Jay our other team member Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk M ike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations He has advanced quic ker than any of the schedulers I ve seen In fact he has gone from very m inimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and process es to other people in the industry with more experience than him In short Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team His abilities and h ard work have reduced our transport fees kept our headcount low he has fu lfilled the responsibilities of two people and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals Mike is a superior employee His knowledge ability and hard work are es sential to the success of the Texas Desk Please support

previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going pink i n one room and a portion of the entry way lime sherbet green in the other portion of the entry way There is a lot of trim 4 doors and a 20 ft ce iling in the living room and entry way So it is taking quite a while to c omplete One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking di sposal toilet flanges alarm system In the middle of trying to finish p ainting we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile I got the floors ready we paid to have the tile laid Tonya wants ever ything done now It doesn t bother her that I haven t finished a single pr oject since we started the whole renovation thing But IT S KILLING ME I would like just one finished product One small room would be fine The house is looking a lot better though I m trying to not let the work take time away from the kids so I usually s tart after 8pm each night Plus when I do work while the kids are running around I pay a high price Last week I was painting the baseboards in the dining room with the gallon of white semi gloss next to me on the floor I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle in the middle of the floor Jake was coming into the room watching and c limbing up and down the step ladder 6 ft he climbs to the very top like it s nothing Other people come in and see him up there and freak out We just let him go He is big into cleaning guts it from his mom so whe n he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up I told him to take it to Mam a He started out the doorway but came back in and walked behind me I just kept working thinking that he was watching me Then I noticed out of the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me When I turned to loo k I just lost my breath Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the paint can pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet White paint was just pouring off the bottle It looked like someone had p oured paint straight out of the can onto the floor Thank goodness it was latex after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up Cole has helped me wit h some of the work such as sanding the walls But he carried his work a little farther than I wanted Yesterday he had a friend over They got h is tools play sander grinder circular saw screw drivers climbed up on his bunk bed and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling You should have seen the mess I am taking a break this weekend though Cole and I are going camping at L ake Livingston I am really looking forward to it I m trying to start so mething with him and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger wher e we do a guy thing each month Last month I took Cole to his first Rocket s game He loved it They are getting too big too fast At work I guess I m becoming a full fledge trader I will be getting my o wn book in a couple of days I m pretty nervous about that There s not a lot of activity in the training coaching area around here hard to believe huh But we ll see how it goes The last of the HPL AEP people are m oving out of the building tonight Everything is on course to close the sa le on June 1st Anyway I hope

complete gas trading transactions We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas This of course is due to the bankruptcy As a result we are not able to sale Tenaska s excess fuel We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price but they do not want it gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while In December we had to cut 10 000 day from the 7th through the 27th For January we haven t had to cut yet but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future 2 For November activity which was settled in Dec ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold However due to the bankruptcy we could not make payments out ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA I don t know how Enron s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management Please give me a call or e mail me We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning
