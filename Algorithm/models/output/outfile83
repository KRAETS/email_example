Don I enjoyed your article You are right we are a little sensitive That s a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized I must admit I almost e mailed you after reading your pre

Surely there are players in every program w ho have fights with their girlfriends or who drink too much and don t have the sense to leave a party when asked My problem is that whenever a NU p layer messes up it is news It s as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star re porter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners just waitin g for some news to break I don t think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them College kids everywhere do such things and pay f or them quietly I don t wish we knew about every infraction at every scho ol It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stic k to the event they are covering This all started when we were the defend ing and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman can didate in the backfield The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news be cause of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense He b ecame the posterboy for abuse of females and perhaps rightfully so but en ough already Leave us alone until God forbid we end up with another Law rence Phillips Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue Let me thank you for your p ost game article which was fair and balanced You are right Most NU fans are good a few of us are not good fans or role models NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams

of TOTal yards their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were
