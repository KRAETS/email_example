sectors of the U S bond market S P Credit Indices are quoted in basis points over the U S Treasury yield curve once daily Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are represented in the S P U S Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the S P U S Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index Each credit index represents the distribution of U S corporate issues across different rating categories and subsectors Re balancing occurs regularly to ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues

comments on the state of our VaR models The issues always become more controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would like to share with you a few observations 1 Critical importance of a good risk management system to Enron and the P E ratio A number of recent analysts reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors One way to counter this crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron s risk amnageemnt system and our strong risk amangeemnt culture Our claims regarding the strong risk management technology and culture should be however supported by reality It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can convince the external parties stock analysts creditors credit rating agencies about the quality of our financial technology This can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology as we have done frequently in the past by reality 2 Inputs from the trading desks vs historical calibration The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input information as possible should come from the market i e trading desks or should be calibrated to the market observations as opposed to historical data One immediate improvement we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks information and move if possible to replace them with market based forward looking data One should not assume of course that the information coming from the trading desks is perfect One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices curves The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized forward price volati oty If this is not the case back testing for some portfolios will systematically fail One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements It will allow us to identify the source of problems we see in some books 3 VaR process management Given the size of our trading operation we are running a VaR factory a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality of the results Specifically I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility for the model calibration Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization and resides somewhere between the IT RAC and Research As a result we have inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls Some inputs used currently in the system are 2 years old Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects In my view some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal usefulness and in some case on questionable understanding of mathematics Of course I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to bring these issues to the table in a meeting involving all the concerned parties and
