they want to do the deal through 2003 That is really 2003 2004 as it incldues Nov Mar Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal This would be OK with us 2 Character of service The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW Why would they want this This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn t flow as we would shut in puchases We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis 3 Pricing Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport I think that is what we proposed If not then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of transport plus fuel 4 Conditions Noms must be in at 8 00 am This is very important and the a deal killer We need time to manage the position Also the weekend issue needs to be addressed As we have discussed weekends trade as the same quantity each day If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday that is fairly ewaasy to deal with If they want to have lower takes on Sunday this is more difficult ad increases costs We might be able to craft a solution to this however Chris Enron
