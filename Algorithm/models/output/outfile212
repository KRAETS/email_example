clubbers party goers and unsuspecting pub regulars to be more alert and cautious when accepting a drink offer from a girl There is a date rape drug going around called beer and sometimes bourbon it appears in liquid form The drug is being used by female sexual predators at parties to convince male victims to have sex with them Beer is available virtually anywhere All girls have to do is persuade a guy to consume a few units of beer and simply ask him home for no strings attached sex Men are rendered helpless against such attacks After several beers men will often succumb to performing sex acts on horrific looking women who they would never normally be attracted to Men often wake up after having beer with only hazy memories of what happened to them the night before just a vague feeling that something bad occurred At other times these unfortunate men might be conned into familiar scam known as a relationship apparently men are easier victims for this scam after the beer has been administered and they have already been sexually attacked Forward this to every male you know However if you fall victim to this insidious drug and the predatory women administering it there are male

offend anyone in the community In an act of tolerance the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all Proud to be an American signs removed so as to not offend international students I for one am quite disturbed by these actions of so called American citizens and I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture Since the terrorist attacks on September 11 we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans However the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D C when the politically correct crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others I am not against immigration nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America In fact our country s population is almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants however there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country and apparently some native Americans need to understand First of all it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you in any way This idea of America being a multi cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity As Americans we have our own culture our own society our own language and our own lifestyle This culture called the American Way has been developed over centuries of struggles trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom Our forefathers fought bled and died at places such as Bunker Hill Antietam San Juan Iwo Jima Normandy Korea Vietnam We speak English not Spanish Arabic Chinese Japanese Russian or any other language Therefore if you wish to become part of our society learn our language In God We Trust is our national motto This is not some off the wall Christian Right Wing political slogan it is our national motto It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency We adopted this motto because Christian men and women on Christian principles founded this nation and this is clearly documented throughout our history If it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of Government then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools God is in our pledge our National Anthem nearly every patriotic song and in our founding documents We honor His birth death and resurrection as holidays and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis If God offends you then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms We celebrate Independence Day Memorial Day Veterans Day and Flag Day We have parades picnics and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag As an American I have the right to wave my flag sing my national anthem quote my national motto and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose If the Stars and Stripes offend you or you don t like Uncle Sam then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet The American culture is our way of life our heritage and we are proud of it We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change and we really don t care how you did things where you came from We are Americans like it or not this is our country our land and our lifestyle Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government culture or society and we will allow you every opportunity to do so But once you are done complaining whining and griping about our flag our pledge our national motto or our way of life I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom the right to leave Barry Loudermilk If you agree pass this onto other Americans It is time to take a stand
