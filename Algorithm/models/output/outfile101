Subject Estimate for Pooling Service on TW Lindy I agree with Lynn not only for the valid reasons she articulated but because I think we may have a conflict of interest here You see Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding As such we are currently involved albeit indirectly in negotiations with SoCal and other parties regarding the ability and mechanism for SoCal to recover costs to implement unbundled services on their system System pooling is one of those services I ll defer to counsel on this but in my humble opinion I don t think it wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on First its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give another party information that could prove to be prejudicial Secondly and probably more practically if Transwestern were of a mind to it could intentionally skew the results of their survey Unless collective wisdom feels differently I d suggest we politely decline on some reasonably nebulous basis i e we don t know we forgot we really didn t account for it separately it s been too long the people who might have known are no longer here whatever That way we don t appear

Enron ENRON Julia White ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject SoCal GIR settlement telecon I participated in a teleconference today at 3 00 p m with several members of the all party settlement group The ALJ assigned to the GIR case Andrea Biren has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal s Motion to Extend the deadline for filing the all party settlement Although I personally haven t seen the document yet it was the primary focus of the meeting According to accounts from the group Judge Biren s ruling did not grant SoCal s motion for extension Rather she will hear arguments on the motion during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday April 11 Judge Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the Commission Unfortunately she is silent on what date the testimony would be due originally testimony was due on April 17 In addition Judge Biren s ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into something different during Tuesday s prehearing conference ie a different procedural schedule or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol The telecon group decided to do the following 1 approach CPUC commissioner Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all party settlement and ask him to intervene in favor of the extension 2 go before Judge Biren on Tuesday as a group and individually if necessary and request that in leiu of a full scale testimony procedure would she accept a process whereby similar to what was done in the PG E settlement parties file declarations in favor of one settlement versus another and then the Judge supervises conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the settlement If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process one which arguably doesn t offer as complete a record in the case which most on the call felt was the likely outcome then would she agree to a schedule whereby she grants the SoCal motion the all party settlement is filed on April 17 then all parties including the Norm Pedersen group would have the chance to file testimony only testimony not additional declarations indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons logic including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives on or before May 5 As far as the all party settlement document is concerned SoCal will be forwarding a preliminary as yet incomplete draft for the parties to review but not to comment on SoCal intends to circulate another more complete version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments changes As far as Transwestern is concerned I ve spoken independently with the team Susan Mark and Jeff Dasovich Each of us will review and provide TW comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document Susan will be representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday Mark Baldwin will

aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant Mark Baldwin of IGS Our consulting agreement with IGS which has now terminated provided for a flat fee plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract identified by IGS and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement During the term of the agreement TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern Southern was also on Lorraine s list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity Also the capacity was posted for all to see So while Mark can certainly claim he identified the deal he was not alone in doing so Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant On the other hand I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee However since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee this position is not as strong as I d like it to be and IGS might sue TW The amount in dispute could be as much as 200 000 depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS let me know I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal just in case they do decide to take us to court

testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR NGS proceeding The first scheduled for May 24 will be held in the Sutter Room A B of the Hilton Hotel on O Farrell in SFO The session is scheduled to go from 9 00AM to 5 00PM Lunch will be brought in On May 25 we will meet in the same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for 10 00AM at the Commission s offices This practice cross session will start no later than 12Noon and go to 4 00PM Lunch will also be available I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most efficiently As of today we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony Given that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters I d like to suggest we bifurcate the sessions devoting May 24 from the hours of 9 00AM 2 00PM to capacity issues and 2 00PM 5 00PM to the retail panel On the 25th we would go from 12Noon 2 30PM on capacity and 2 30 4 00PM on retail matters I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective witnesses prior to the panel hearings We should concentrate on nailing down the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions After reviewing the draft testimony s over the last few days I think we are going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission s most promising options

at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage and the rest could be scheduled IT Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me As currently configured TW s system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled Similarly if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day say 50 and 60 of the capacity in fact became available TW s system today would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60 not limit them to 50 TW s tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported Our question was whether by changing TW s LFT system as described in the first paragraph we wouldn t be leaving some firm transportation

post the individual bids as they come in but do not post the name of the shipper We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time I notice you call them sealed bids on page 4 not true if we re going to show them Page 3 why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding Especially since we plan to attract brand new shippers by offering this service Our credit dept folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day If we re asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places our example should be to 3 decimal places e g 0 351 Page 7 an Capacity Trading Agreement should be a Capacity Trading Agreement Page 8 So we don t appear low tech let s go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for

really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of or prior to the first bid I recommend stating You must submit a Request for Service prior to making your initial bid so they don t think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid Page 9 Under When TW will Respond need to specify how notification will be sent Page 14 Column that says Price should say Rate for

EnronOnline proposal here is my 2 cents worth The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW s tariff for some reason that s never been clear to me See Section 13 A Sheet No 18 All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline See Section 13 D but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process not to an open season for other capacity Even if the one month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids Tony am I right about this The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions beginning on Sheet No 72 TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically I ve found nothing in else in TW s tariff that would appear to address an online open season one

will put fact to the upstream capacities into the Socal system Well I fear that the other pipeline lines will shape the facts to their agendas and we will have a distorted landscape into the Socal system The downside I perceive is that the judge will 1 want to Let the Market decide via increasing the maximum receipt point capacity allowed or 2 want further comments on the entire Socal receipt point capacity structure These two onerous outcomes can be avoided if the judge receives a consensus Exhibit at least from the Settlement parties that is explained in a consistent manner and with

Enrononline","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"Tony I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis However I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition As you may be aware the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America NGPL come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers NGPL s solution was to come up with an auction process and there is a whole line of cases if you re interested The underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily But of course the Commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1 the tariff and 2 the NGA doesn t it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim basis Also in your memo I d give an example i e if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding but then award the capacity to Sempra assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the Enrononline process Now for some trivia Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we could post a different method other than that prescribed in the tariff for determining best bid In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case In Northwest Pipeline 85 FERC P 61 335 the Commission stated The Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway in open season provisions to either include in their tariff a single non discriminatory bid evaluation methodology or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins The only problem is I am not sure we have that flexibility since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write I d be happy to

resulting forward haul problem Probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper This would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our FERC filing otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice Another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as LFT daily FTS 1 or even FTS 3

our meeting last week John Elizabeth Gerry Richard Dave I discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process We had several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows Regulatory Legal issue Can we have contract specific language on our firm contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel discount cash option to an acquiring shipper If we must offer this special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at this time Shipper nomination issue How will we handle shipper nomination line items that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts Could we default these 02 overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using our existing tariff fuel This would make the process of trying to reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes scheduled paid for in cash Tariff Sheet issue When you state in the tariff provision that The shipper may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a receipt point on shipper s service agreement Does this only apply to the shipper s primary receipt points I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues If you feel like we should meet to discuss I will be glad to set up another meeting Please let me know Thanks Ramona

about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP 12 31 92 Interconnect Agreement Sec 1 3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200 000 on an interruptible basis Sec 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded Sec 4 2 limits damages no consequential damages The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause 2 18 93 letter amendment Sec 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200 000 into TW s system provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140 Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec 1 3 of 12 92 agreement 9 25 95 letter amendment Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250 000 once the San Juan expansion is effective My initial conclusions It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250 000 on a firm basis provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250 000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP In that case we can argue impossibility of performance Also we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments they will say we should have known by now Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement even if it means expensive system modifications That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement

predetermined financial hurdles Proposal 5000 Each month TW actively negotiating project 1500 month each project Letter of Intent 5000 Signed Agreement 10 000 Incentive Fee To be determined When I spoke with Mark he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services 5000 mo and market development services including SoCal OIR related services 3000 mo This e mail addresses the project development fee structure only The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one time retainer of 15 000 and a monthly retainer of 5000 plus expenses and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party identified by IGS under this agreement As you know the identified by language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal Fortunately the ambiguity worked to Transwestern s advantage in that case but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement Mark s proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per project basis This immediately eliminates the identified by problem because we won t be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we re interested in him working on I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue we will pay him according to these terms and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project as needed For each project we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement I ve outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion The numbers are Mark s we ll have to discuss whether they are appropriate I ve omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern Call me after you ve reviewed this and let s discuss how you want to proceed From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement IGS may present brief preliminary project proposals to Transwestern If Transwestern desires IGS s assistance in developing a particular project it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions 1 Retainer for project development 1000 month plus expenses Project development shall include but not be limited to research due diligence market analysis negotiation with counterparties to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern and preparing a detailed written proposal Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project specific requirements Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project 2 If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS s written proposal or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal it shall pay IGS a fee of the lesser of 5000 or of the net present value of the project Accepting the project means that the project meets Transwestern s financial regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion 3 If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project it shall pay IGS 10 000 Additionally the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project I will also include provisions on termination confidentiality etc

appropriate because we lack market power While we probably do lack market power the consensus of the legal regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built in feature of the transport rate which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter let s discuss how it should be improved The other significant change also based on my meeting with legal regulatory is that I ve structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option In other words a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero

meeting","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"Yesterday Jeff Fawcett Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and legal regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options Overall the meeting was very positive We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives However the regulatory people Sarah Tomalty Ed Ross had a couple of issues The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates They have run into situations in which pipelines examples Koch El Paso have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do deals with them In fact one of the problems with Koch has been Koch s price option deals with its affiliate The perception is that the affiliates by using funny money can always make themselves the highest bidder with a net benefit to the entire organization pipeline affiliate The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate if it is the highest bidder to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder The presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity Dynegy s proposal would encourage affiliates to pay real dollars While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing affiliates Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates It is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our filing and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates Shelley I know you ve discussed this issue with Ed already and our reactions were the same Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don t believe we re part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA s ability to do business with TW We can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate My analysis of this issue is that since we re proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed If you think this is not the right answer please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets Sarah s question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest Like the Indicated Shippers Dynegy appeared interested in an all customer

washer dryer connections in the garage part work for sure A I have a bad feeling about those connections I ll get them up and running and can get someone to haul the old washer off Q I am guessing that they would need to be gas not electric A I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible Q At one point you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days

the cost and environmental requirements are met The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an eligible facility under section 157 202 b 2 i they are necessary to provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is 20 200 000 Sec 157 208 If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7 c certificate I ve researched the incremental rate question and here s what I ve been able to find out In the context of a 7 c application FERC generally requires use of existing Part 284 rates This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to construct the San Juan lateral TW requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum The Commission stated however that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral So TW made a Section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau rates As for whether an open season would be required I assume it would not be if Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral However if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we ll probably want to have an open season In any event in the context of a 7 c application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs so it would be to our advantage to sell 100 of the new capacity At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the Big Sandy lateral ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed I hope this helps if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know Michele Winckowski 08 17 2000 01 39 PM To Drew Fossum ET S Enron ENRON Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron Enron Maria Pavlou ET S Enron ENRON Dari Dornan ET S

Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the mainline in Arizona Although the final negotiation are not complete certain options are being evaluated I need some assistance in interpreting the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this project The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and approximately 40 miles of pipe As these facilities are non mainline it may be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice provisions of TW s blanket certificate provided the project satisfies the blanket criteria generally costs and environmental With this in mind I have the following issues and questions Preliminarily marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an incremental rate to recover the cost of the project Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for approval under the prior notice provisions Note Generally Subpart F of Part 157 blanket regulations does not address service issues as transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission s regulations However the regulations o157 204 set forth Who may apply for a blanket certificate The criteria includes among other things any interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission Therefore would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the proposed facilities would be blanket eligible Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit section 4 rate filing or is a case specific certificate required As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion Is an open season required for the project My opinion is NO Do you agree Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated Thanks MW

s marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system For example since TW and ENA are both Enron companies if ENA buys a call option it is essentially a free option ENA could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them with the proceeds going to Enron s bottom line BP suggested that TW s marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers BP s concern is that TW s filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service so they want TW s options program to be as restricted as possible Dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder s bid if the affiliate s bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates At this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program If BP and others have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines Right of first refusal Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal Our response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff Negotiated rate BP s representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such We did not respond to this or discuss it further However TW s position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate Hoarding capacity Several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity It was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists Their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier We acknowledged that the potential for

may differ from the noted treatment depending on the true facts I have a call to James Centilli for his thoughts I also have not reviewed any written language so this is based on our conversations therefore the facts may change depending on the final arrangement Based on my understanding the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities Because El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not record these fees as a CIAC for tax In short the management fee is just normal operational type revenue The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid the gross up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS Code Section 118 b However please note that the management fee is still taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received It is just not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW and not contributed from El Paso I have a call to James Centilli to confirm Clarification on CIAC IRC 118 b This is a code section that governs for tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes For tax the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received and the asset is depreciated normally 15 years MACRS The Gross up paid is the time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer requesting the service The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for tax For tax the money is received and taxed The money is then used indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 years MACRS for tax The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross up of approximately 50 000 The 50 000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing the deal with El Paso The lost cost should be off set in part from rate recovery I don t know how this piece will work James Centilli should be able to confirm Let me know if we need to discuss further I am out of the office after 12 30 today to return on Monday I will check my voice mail However If you need to move on this or need additional help please call me on my mobile number 832 647 4610 Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Susan Scott 09 12 2000 05 27 PM To Robert Guthrie Corp Enron ENRON cc Subject CIAC Robert here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum explaining what we re doing with El Paso Can you elaborate on the meter fee approach I m not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC and why we get to include it in the rate base If you can add to this I would appreciate it or just give me a call and we can discuss it further Thanks so much for your help El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities Estimated cost 280 000 EPFS will contribute 165 000 pursuant to an interconnect agreement The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross up associated with a contribution in aid of construction The Internal Revenue Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other contributions made by a customer or potential customer collectively CIACs are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from gross income Accordingly such amounts are required to be included in gross income EPFS has proposed instead of the 165 000 being paid in a lump sum that the contribution instead be paid in equal monthly installments as a meter fee Our tax department has advised me that while this approach does not absolve TW from tax liability on that revenue it does have a couple of advantages It would remove the contribution from the CIAC category why is it not a CIAC and TW would be allowed to include it in its rate base Additionally TW would be allowed to treat the interconnect facilities as a depreciable asset ","sender_address":"susan.scott@enron.com","message_id":"<16194767.1075846728164.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","recipient_address":"robert.guthrie@enron.com"},{"sent_time":"2000-09-14

Facilities if and to the extent damage is caused by TW s negligent acts or omissions To complete my modification to Section 5 3 TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it is willing to assume in any contract year This amount could be the amount of Calpine s deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser amount Whatever the amount chosen please remember that TW is self insured for the first 2M each occurrence Therefore what is the amount of risk that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its existing Facility due to TW s negligent operations That is the amount to insert in the blank space in Section 5 3 FYI the changes in Sections 3 1 and 4 1 b and c and the striking of Section 4 1 d do not create any substantive

gouging","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"As to your question about what s going on in California I ve done some reading and here are my thoughts The Nov 1 FERC order in Docket No EL00 95 000 in which the Commission ordered a 150 MWh price cap among other things was predicated on the Commission s authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act Specifically the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that any rate charge or classification for jurisdictional services or any rule regulation practice or contract affecting such rate charge or classification is unjust or unreasonable the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge classification rule regulation practice or contract that should be in effect The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction but fixed the areas within its jurisdiction Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission s jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable In any event if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates its authority to do so would be much clearer The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable Just and reasonable has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means As we all know too well the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably However my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above max rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal struck within a pipeline s tariff authority to be unjust and unreasonable The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200 300 increases in their electricity bills The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state By contrast TW s transport rates for its short term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice It is far from being a consumer issue and besides the elections are over However as you and I have already discussed we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC s attention We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals Kathy why don t you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso Kern PGT NW Drew obviously I ve only

start 2 could the political regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing I e if the CPUC whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power its not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U S congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to 14 MMBtu as happened on Friday If that happens its just another small

sequel","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"Maria and Drew this is a long winded e mail but please bear with me The problem As you probably remember several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern s tariff if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate and the additional frustrating language a ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures At our last meeting we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices However since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW the marketers haven t done any index based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I ve quoted above However my research has indicated that absent our 1 bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2 showing that TW lacks market power we are probably stuck with this language Why the problem exists you may already know Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement RM95 6 000 the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost of service based tariff rates T he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost based traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service Thus the recourse rate mitigates market power The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations when capacity is constrained a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff The example cited by the Commission If a pipeline has 100 Dth d available and two shippers request that capacity one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of 5 and another a negotiated rate of 6 then each would be allocated 50 Dth d on a pro rata basis assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates it voluntarily added the statement that if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority Solutions I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question I feel as if I ve really been chasing my tail here I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now But I keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power which Drew is where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid October Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system I think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this Do you agree Stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition Might be worth it to us though Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate After all we do have authority to charge negotiated rates We ve seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone However despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers it s unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency We wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure But I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission s requirement that recourse rates be available That requirement has not changed Have either of you seen anything to the contrary I would like to meet with you two plus several others I have in mind to discuss this preferably early this week Tues or Wed but would like to discuss briefly with you first Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes Thanks

more modest reforms are approved He may ask the other 20 Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter Susan Mar k 20 and I spoke about this idea later and we ve got some reservations about TW s 20 role in admonishing the CPUC We should probably wait to see this letter 20 first before committing to anything Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state California 20 Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more 20 moderate approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas 01 SoCal sy stem In his draft decision Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g 20 of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e 20 less far reaching Interim Settlement IS submitted in December 1999 SoCal San Diego Gas a nd 20 Electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the IS reaching a 20 comprehensive agreement in April this year But since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a 20 consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name The draft language notes that 20 the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements Recent events 01 lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this 20 investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm 20 tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed 018 according t o the 20 draft order 01 This unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment 20 and we cannot approve it We do not however wish to commit to paralysis 20 until 2006 as the post interim settlement would have us do Accordingly 20 we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption 20 with modifications of the IS 018 The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic 20 capacity expansion by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge Calif with rolled in rates if certain criteria 20 are met El Paso Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa l 20 to automatically expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of 20 curtailments oc curred 20 El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele r 20 when only certain customers would benefit 20 The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge 20 expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss The draft decision would also 01 07 End SoCal 01 s current 01 windowing 018 process which limits shipp ers 01 ability to 20 change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system It is replaced with an 20 announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point 01 07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations 01 07 Institute an operational flow order OFO procedure Provides a foru m for 20 more changes in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made 01 07 Set up 01 pools 018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar e intended to 20 increase the liquidity of gas trading 01 07 Make changes to balancing rules while retaining the current 10 mon thly 20 imbalance tolerance 01 07 Make SoCal 01 s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci ng rules 20 and penalties as all other shippers 01 07 Allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assig n and 20 reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a SoCal electronic bulletin 20 board set up for it 01 07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex ceeding 20 that required for core minimum reliability and 01 07 Provide for rate recovery of up to 3 5 million in implementation co sts In addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from 20 rates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges elimina te 20 the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs The threshold fo r 20 participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core 20 aggregators Bilas 01 draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to 20 open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et 20 conditions Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft 01 The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a 20 differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport 20 and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs 20 if more competition is allowed 018 20 Bilas wrote in the draft decision 01 With half the state already committ ed to 20 a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the 20 benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this 20 time With one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not 20 foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead 01 We choose to take a cautious approach again 018 the draft continues 01 Rather 20 than proceeding to unbundle transmission in Southern California now we approve with 20 modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market Additionally w e 20 unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume r 20 protection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core 20 aggregation programs 018 The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and 20 other restruc turing in the future 01 but believe that at this point in time the certain 20 benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers 018 All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be 20 discussed The draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC 01 s Dec 21 meeting 20

thought then he seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos into things to tell me he has issues and that he d been married before Needless to say that was pretty much the end of things It s made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning that I m still optimistic about my dating future How about you Concerning Kappa I ll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch with Corey s in Law School at Texas doing great of course and has already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she graduates Jessica

us there The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in the last cycle I do not believe any changes are necessary there either The tariff language as it s currently written says we shall issue an OFO and we would but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty If you see any roadblocks on

and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing I got there about 7 30 with Nick and the group s size swelled to about 12 by 8 30 9 00 About 8 00 I saw Kevin Ted s pal the one you meet a steak night wandering around LW s obviously in search of someone Can you believe it He Ted knew I had organized this gathering I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted s attendance mind you Ted was not in the email distribution and he had the nerve to come Anyway Kevin saw me and came over to chat He informed me that our friend Ted should be there shortly to which I responded You would know better than me at this point The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms bad terms etc I said there really weren t any terms I just hadn t heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted s head and cause a big scene When I said no I think he was genuinely disappointed I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the loss and that while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more with each passing day the loss seems less and less like much of a loss Kevin told me I was better off without Ted To go even further he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his girl friends He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy i e fun to be around good stories etc he wasn t good dating material I agreed with Kevin saying Ted is a great guy he just makes a lousy man don t you like that one I then went on to say Anyway I m destined for bigger and better things right Kevin Much bigger and much better About this time my parents showed up the plot thickens I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dum da dum dum Ted shows up He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eye contact with me I give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant how s it going He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about I told him the Navy he said don t get Kevin started or you ll never shut him up Then he walked away He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join Ted My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished It really was a great night I would almost say I was glowing I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn t a show for Ted s benefit I really was having a great time So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted Kevin s table to say good bye to Kevin It was awesome Ted s sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldn t even make eye contact I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House Needless to say I was very hung over today Anyway there s the story He s a complete and utter ass hole So I m done And no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces Now on to a fun subject my trip to London I bought my ticket today I think I got hosed a little bit but it was the cheapest ticket I could find 450 before taxes I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7 00

issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I ll excerpt here In Maritimes Northeast Pipeline L L C 80 FERC P 61 346 1997 Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted Commission staff denied the blanket request but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut off dates FN29 in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive On the other hand Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public Generally the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities FN30 However in the instance case the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and thus evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services Therefore we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut off dates to be made public FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events FN30 See e g Colorado Interstate Gas Company 76 FERC P 61 291 1996 In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America 82 FERC P 61 037 1998 which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements In ANR Pipeline Co the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power Even where transportation competition exists that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases Just to make sure I found everything I ll do some follow up sometime in the

around LW s obviously in search of someone Can you believe it He Ted knew I had organized this gathering I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted s attendance mind you Ted was not in the email distribution and he had the nerve to come Anyway Kevin saw me and came over to chat He informed me that our friend Ted should be there shortly to which I responded You would know better than me at this point The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms bad terms etc I said there really weren t any terms I just hadn t heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted s head and cause a big scene When I said no I think he was genuinely disappointed I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the loss and that while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more with each passing day the loss seems less and less like much of a loss Kevin told me I was better off without Ted To go even further he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his girl friends He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy i e fun to be around good stories etc he wasn t good dating material I agreed with Kevin saying Ted is a great guy he just makes a lousy man don t you like that one I then went on to say Anyway I m destined for bigger and better things right Kevin Much bigger and much better About this time my parents showed up the plot thickens I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dum da dum dum Ted shows up He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eye contact with me I give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant how s it going He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about I told him the Navy he said don t get Kevin started or you ll never shut him up Then he walked away He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join Ted My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished It really was a great night I would almost say I was glowing I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn t a show for Ted s benefit I really was having a great time So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted Kevin s table to say good bye to Kevin It was awesome Ted s sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldn t even make eye contact I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House Needless to say I was very hung over today Anyway there s the story He s a complete and utter ass hole So I m done And no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces Now on to a fun subject my trip to London I bought my ticket today I think I got hosed a little bit but it was the cheapest ticket I could find 450 before taxes I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7 00 a m Friday the 6th and depart about 11 00 a m on Tuesday the 10th I m very excited about the trip I really need to get out of Houston I leave the activities in your capable hands bear in mind I will have to see Darren and

informs me that he is going to be trading corn yes you heard me corn for Enron While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned

As a result he s decided to get in his long visit home ASAP i e I m leaving tomorrow Friday to go to California for a week I make sure I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving tomorrow and 1

I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble I guess the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren s apartment because he d left his keys in his locker at the Met Well if you ll remember at the end of the email he said he d talk to me later which is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could go get a drink that night or not I knew he had his presentation that day so I figured he d call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah I received no call no email no nothing Of course always wanting to give others the benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than expected and afterward he d decided to just go to Austin and pick up his friend from the airport If that were the case

brighter note tell Katy I think I m going to try and come Oct 4 Oct 9 so that I can see both of you Also I understand your dilemma regarding Claudia but I definitely don t think you should look a gift horse in the mouth if you know what I mean That first month after Katy leaves is going to be awkward so it s best to have someone there even if only to act as a crutch until you find your footing I m sure Monique can testify to a little extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off And speaking of Matt no I haven t heard a thing from the turn coat I need to shoot him an email and see how things are shaping up for him I m willing to bet though that moving to Austin hasn t solved all of his problems just transplanted to a prettier location Get back to me with anything I m desperate for positive energy Oh and I m going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk about swinging a rotation in London he has 75 employees over there that work for him

question","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW s failure to deliver gas under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar quarter Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than Dec Jan Feb July and Aug Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as maintenance I m not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned as the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time I am also not completely comfortable calling this force majeure because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party however since the definition does include binding order of any court or governmental authority we could possibly say this is force majeure if we re reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety rule In that event our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure notice If not we can argue that since this is not maintenance but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner the shippers rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions In that case damages if any would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer however the outage is going to be relatively short and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction I recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans this will reduce the

Godmother what are you doing here after all these years The Fairy godmother replied Well Cinderella since you have lived a good wholesome life since we last met I have decided to grant you 3 wishes Is there anything for which your heart still yearns Cinderella was taken aback overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension Instantly her rocking chair was turned into solid gold Cinderella was stunned Bob her old faithful cat jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch quivering with fear Cinderella said Oh thank you Fairy Godmother The Fairy Godmother replied It is the least I can do What does your heart want for your second wish Cinderella looked down at her frail body and said I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again At once her wish having been desired became reality and her beautiful youthful visage had returned Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke You have one more wish what shall you have Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says I wish for you to transform Bob my old cat into a beautiful and handsome young man Magically Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make up that when complete he stood before her a man so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet The Fairy Godmother again spoke Congratulations Cinderella Enjoy your new life And with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity she was gone For a few eerie moments Bob and Cinderella looked into each other s eyes Cinderella sat breathless gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen Then Bob walked over to Cinderella who sat transfixed in her rocking chair and held her close in his young muscular arms He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he whispered I bet you regret having me neutered now don t you

Basically the deal was that Dynegy s minimum pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso s transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold The parties based the threshold on El Paso s monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9 30 97 The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy s monthly reservation charge to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month This provision of course met with heavy opposition however FERC allowed it FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT it was not unduly discriminatory The unduly discriminatory conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal gas transportation market the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept

about Congressional funding for creative arts in America since NEA provides major support for NPR National Public Radio PBS Public Broadcasting System and numerous other creative and performing arts If NEA is lost or weakened our lives will be similarly diminished In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and streamline their services some government officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile Currently taxes from the general public for PBS equal 1 12 per person per year and the National Endowment for the Arts equals 64 a year A January 1995 CNN USA Today Gallup poll indicated that 76 of Americans wish to keep funding for PBS third only to national defense and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding Each year the Senate and House Appropriations Committees each have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill The goal each year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year which is October 1 The only way that our representatives can be

this stands for The full list will be forwarded to the President of the United States the Vice President and the Speaker of the House whose office has in the past been the instigator of the action to

experiences I do feel the highlighted section below is now more appropriate than ever One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when they trust Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one s level of trust to grow exponentially negative experiences can cause irreparable harm If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is violated it colours every aspect of your life There are too many people in this world that have become bitter and cynical not because they were born that way but because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times that trust was thrown back in their face I don t mean to suggest from the above that one should live in a day to day mind set of distrust but rather that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a great deal more about them and their character The smallest acts and statements can in fact say the most so always be observant This includes listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of people whom you respect To that end I have one last comment I am constantly amazed and periodically reminded what fragile creatures we humans are That beyond the hype and self grandizing the basic components of ourselves our experiences fears cares concerns needs etc cannot be completely disregarded and will always be a part of us I think that only by recognizing those components and trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger

issue","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"As you know current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 250 MMcf d of gas to Topock In the context of the Gallup Expansion Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf d to Topock Once the Gallup expansion is built Transwestern will have a total of 290 MMcf d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point 40 MMcf d more than PG E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern s potential liability to shippers would be if PG E s refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG E Topock The legal answer is that Transwestern s tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper More specifically Rate Schedule FTS 1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper In December January February July and August the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered In all other months the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75 of nominated confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern s failure to provide service under an FTS 1 contract A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge including for example the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper s inability to fulfill contractual obligations Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages Can we meet briefly to discuss this I m available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a m or after lunch on Friday or we can discuss a meeting time for next week Thank you

Items","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"Christine Here s a brief answer to your questions With regard to segmentation Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity so we would have considerable leeway here The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate or primary points Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions including our current restriction on changing primary points that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW On hourly service I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without running afoul of the Peak and Off Peak Rates i e seasonal rates provisions of the order In other words I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service As for how to communicate with our customers I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion I realize the order becomes effective March 27 however compliance filings are not due until May 1 and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1 Before the beginning of April the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well organized presentation to persons outside the company The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available In the meantime if your customers have questions I ll be

Lindberg Lindy Donoho ET S Enron ENRON TK Lohman ET S Enron ENRON Subject 637 Summary Items Thanks Susan for the 637 summary Here are a couple of items that I need additional clarification on 1 Segmentation You summarized Pipelines must allow segmentation to the extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff provisions Does this mean for example an Ignacio to California contract i e 40 000 Dth d at a 20 total path rate could be segmented by the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM d from Ignacio to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM d from Blanco to California If they could would the 20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 MM d 20 for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or would they only pay the 20 applied to the contract s 40 MM d MDQ Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this segmented basis but unless the discount letter providing the 20 specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths if these paths are not already provided as alternate receipt or delivery paths 2 Peak OFF Peak Rates You summarized The policy does not apply to long term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of service TW will eventually file for hourly rates however the parties most interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station or the generation station s own gas supply manager purchaser Most likely these contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even seasonal I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect from the marketplace Thanks for your feedback Since 637 is effective March 27th I am eager to be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more critical issues Thanks

more background The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW s efforts to unbundle under Order No 636 whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas In addition we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as well as our de minimus sales function All Amgas does today is administer our sales function We never eliminated our sales function we just transferred the administration of it to Amgas The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline s sales division be treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate Our standards of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in any of the day to day operations of Transwestern s merchant function As a result the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G FTS 2 transportation service is the unbundled no notice transportation service the former and current sales customers received under Order No 636 I think we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function is even smaller than it was when we unbundled true which is not enough work for an agent to perform and that we ve brought it back in house and explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared operating employee under G Maria From Drew Fossum 03 06 2000 11 02 AM To Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Maria Pavlou ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject Re Gas Sales on TW This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC If we can save the 60 000 yr it would be worth asking FERC for authority to simply use an ET S market services person to administer the farm tap sales from time to time without any functional separation or other junk We could even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable that we are not going to expand the business The NN situation was different I think because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use of its sales rate schedule Would TW use the FTS 2 rate schedule We have never formally discontinued the TW sales function right What do you guys think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver Has it ever approved similar small volume waivers DF From Susan Scott 03 02 2000 04 32 PM To Drew Fossum ENRON Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron ENRON Dari Dornan Enron cc Subject Gas Sales on TW I ve been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas TW no longer has any gas purchase contracts just a handful of sales contracts to persons who granted rights of way to TW Many of these parties don t even buy gas on a regular basis but they still have the contractual right to do so We pay AmGas around 60 000 year to administer the contracts The AmGas contract is terminable on 30 days notice I know that last year NNG re established its pipeline sales division to make occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons i e the base gas deal Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same Looks like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved but would like to hear from you what all was involved behind the scenes in other words was it as easy as it looked Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to waive the Section 284 286 requirements in this instance since the remaining sales contracts are so few and insignificant Your comments would be most appreciated

capacity","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"comments Let me know if you have additional ideas and I ll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects 1 Rate impact on TW customers method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity thus there is no cost shift potential to other shippers Net costs will be separately recorded 2 Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the no tying part 3 Would TW s marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity 4 Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM s customers to the detriment of PNM s customers No PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal Service contract under PNM s tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW 5 How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW s existing open access operations TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM s line from Blanco NM i e the Blanco Hub operated by TW to Rio Puerco NM where PNM s system interconnects with TW s mainline Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW s tariff The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW s FTS 1 LFT and ITS right rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW s system Lorraine we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM Would we be able to acquire on an as needed basis Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff Which would come first our deal with PNM or with our shipper It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios 6 Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities Yes Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system It would enable TW to transport an additional of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW s system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW s system at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently

that you re off to vegas this weekend thanks for the input about clint you re right and i hadn t realized that i fit his type until he defined it now i know why he s so nice to me he does know about brendan of course but since i don t always behave like i have a boyfriend it s easy for guys to not take him too seriously not good i m also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night hope you don t think horrible things about me although it s okay if you do i think horrible things about myself every now and then but i always attribute it to the lessons of life i m curious about your work situations you ve never mentioned them that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here keep me posted on your exciting life otherwise i m doing the right thing to not contact eric right so silly for me to ask but i like being friends with him probably the flirting is fun but it s a dead end At 04 00 PM 4 18 2001 0500 you wrote I think there s probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory The retaliation numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting My mini rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representative of Ted s sex like dirt Fortunately my behavior was very short lived and I completely recognized what I was doing I wouldn t worry about the lecturing it happens when one has a bit to drink that or just utter flapping as in my case Thanks for the compliments but I find it s easy to be around all of your friends that whole like attracts like thing As for the email from Clint he s a cutie Speaking from experience I d watch myself if I were you though the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point but I get the impression that you re just Clint s type and unless you have reciprocal interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious However if there s part of you that is curious like I said I think he s a great guy Okay enough of my lecturing I ve just been caught in couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and I m forced to tell them I just don t feel the same way something that s hard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did occur Well I m off to Vegas this weekend My guess is I won t be getting much sleep Oh well life is tough Susan Embedded Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp image moved to

Clint in London so in brief my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart broken per Someone Like You and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the pain Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at the padres game i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on saturday at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about him on some level but as i drank more i LECTURE more until he finally started walking away from me how embarrassing i am totally embarrassed that i wouldn t shut up even more surprised that eric sent me the email on monday i didn t see it until tuesday since i didn t work monday but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric ang s phone number silly concern but he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch with him now i will totally not make contact with him not even respond to his email don t need to overinflate people s egos i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5

this point but I get the impre ssion that you re just Clint s type and unless you have reciprocal interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious However if there s part of you that is curious like I said I think he s a great guy Okay enough of my lecturing I ve just been caught in a couple of si tuations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and I m forced to tell them I just don t feel the same way something that s h ard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did o ccur Well I m off to Vegas this weekend My guess

Someone Like You and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the pain Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at the padres game i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on saturday at fi rst he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about hi m on some level but as i drank more i LECTURE more until he finally sta rted walking away from me how embarrassing i am totally embarrassed tha t i wouldn t shut up even more surprised that eric sent me the email on m onday i didn t see it until tuesday since i didn t work monday but am bu mmed because i called him monday evening to get eric ang s phone number silly concern but he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch w ith him now i will totally not make contact with him not

posted rates and the tari ff rates If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t he range of dates of the specific deal then the rates must be loaded that way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation process If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate then it looks for the next level which is your posted rates if no posted rates ar e found then it looks for tariff rates on PNR It sounds like to me that T W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis load the

brief shower you ll enjoy an all over message with a facial quality message lotion Then it s your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera grapefruit finishing skin

moisturizer and California grape seeds nature s anti oxidant are the exfoliant in this 20 25 minute body scrub You ll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a

picked some of the best restaurants in san diego i l l try to gather some people to go straight out on thursday evening that wo uld be fun i was going to study on saturday but may have to rethink tha t if you ve found saturday to be better beach weather i do like your plan for friday i ve asked my rooomate for spa suggestions the one i do kn ow of is L Auberge resort in del mar you can probably find info on the web and or call them don t have the phone number handy unfortunately i d efinitely think a jacket is better than a sweater unfortunately it s quite cold today does usually warm up during the day though do you like ba seball i might be responsible for hosting our skybox on saturday so we c ould drop by for a few innings but if not then i can get someone else to be in charge i am taking monday off of work to study all day so it sho uld make me much more relaxed this weekend and i m going to study like cra zy tonight 20 there are several churches near me so we ll probably go in del mar cardif f by the sea or encinitas still working that out but definitely plan on a run on the beach if that appeals to you i ve been so horrible abou t working out these past several weeks 20 since san diego is pretty casual you should be able to bring a pair of bla ck pants or a skirt or something and have it function for both dinner out a nd church and of course i always have sweaters and jackets so you can always borrow something of mine 20 i ll drop you more info once i have it love julie At 11 49 AM 4 10 2001 0500 you wrote Okay given the weather conditions out there right now I m going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing I figure we ll be engaging in the following activities beach shopping dinner going out church and I think you mentioned something about a museum Given those various situations I was wondering what you suggest I bring along For instance am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of go out clothes Also let me know if you hear anything about the spas that way I can try and make a reservation 20 figure Friday mid morning would be a good time We could go for a run in the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study Supposedly it s going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturday as our beach day of course I m completely flexible As for brunch on Sunday I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions George s on the Cove The Marine Room Brockton Villa Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar All of these with the exception of Pacifica Del Mar are in La Jolla so I suppose we d have to take that into consideration There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically All of the places mentioned above in addition to The Fish Market Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina Grill also sounded good

specified date Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3 month term I see no basis for this limitation The term of the FTS 1 agreement is one day renewable from day to day The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS 1 agreement renews If the

For example under TW s tariff which they concede is GISB compliant primary firm cannot bump alt firm in cycle 2 SoCal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in path alt point will be unable to re nominate to its primary point once this alternate capacity I assume they mean USGT s is confirmed According to SoCal this will substantially limit shippers flexibility including the ability to use market area pooling Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process TW and USGT will bump firm shippers I could really use your help in responding to this argument First of all I m not sure I even

the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity we will not however allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped Thus the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper

Needles and 14 000 to Topock So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now and has been posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we d sell it to them without making them take the Topock space That ll be true during the IOS too i e nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process This is just a situation in which we re putting a special package together with the

by giving 30 days notice to Burlington The 12 31 92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement Paragraph 6 provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12 31 02 However the paragraph also provides that the agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty 30 days prior

review the Transwestern Commercial Group job descriptions and proposed organization chart He agreed with the wording of the job descriptions but suggested that the TW employees currently working in NNG s Business Development and Marketing organization be shown on the Transwestern organization chart in a dotted line reporting relationship to him A footnote would identify them as Transwestern employees located in the NNG Business Development Marketing organization which serves as a resource to support the TW Commercial Group in the areas of Risk Management Pricing Structuring Business

to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures However the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything doesn t give NMNG any rights since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement and it s subject to available capacity Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff I think I would recommend we omit it However NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the deal or at least the conversations of the parties If that s the case I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release Comments

Request","message_mailbox":"scott-s","message_folder":"sent","message_body":"With regard to the Commission s limitations on the right of first refusal Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long term contracts that are now subject to ROFR The Commission s rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re execute current contracts The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts In limiting the right of first refusal the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract In light of these conclusions there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline s tariff filing

suggestion I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner say 8 30 9 00 and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie On Saturday we could get up work out grab something for brunch lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs depending on the weather and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work we could even skip
