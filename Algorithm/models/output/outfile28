regards to your online strategy and in particular how you plan to build and scale your emerging online business and relationships E Business Relationships can mean a lot of things At it s core it is understanding the needs of your customers partners and employees collectively your Business Community and getting the right content to the right person to generate the greatest impact in the most

training or just acquiring information As Enron Corp looks ahead it is important to continue to better understand who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with them
