instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Herronen e Journal Number 8384 Judge s Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The term cruelty as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague 20 because it gives fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence and a 20 reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited or required In this case a 20 person of ordinary intelligence would understand that hitting a 13 year old 20 girl more than once in the face severe enough to necessitate a hospital 20 visit pulling her hair or pushing her into a wall causing her to become 20 dizzy would fall within the purview of cruelty The family court order taki ng 20 jurisdiction over the minor child was affirmed Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of defense motion for a lineup Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Cain e Journal Number 8381 Judge s Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant s 20 untimely motion for a lineup An eyewitness testified that she was only an 20 arm s length away from defendant when she saw him key the complainant s 20 vehicle then enter a business The manager of the business notified of th e 20 keying incident shortly after it occurred testified that defendant was the 20 only person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator s description 20 Although eyewitness identification was a material issue a lineup would not 20 have resolved any mistaken identification in this case The trial court 20 also properly considered the untimeliness of the motion and the possible 20 hardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness who resided 20 in another state Defendant s conviction of malicious destruction of proper ty 20 over 100 was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant was the 20 carjacker Identification Witness credibility Whether the lineup was undu ly 20 suggestive Sufficiency of evidence to convict of carjacking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Fordham e Journal Number 8380 Judge s Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan Since both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the 20 man who stole the victim s car and the trial court concluded that the victi m 20 was not confused when he identified the defendant as the carjacker the tri al 20 court s finding that defendant was one of the carjackers was not clearly 20 erroneous There was sufficient evidence based on the identification eviden ce 20 for a rational trier of fact to have concluded that defendant committed the 20 carjacking Affirmed 20 Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficient evidence of intent to convict for arson of a dwelling 20 house Whether defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the requisite 20 intent Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Moss e Journal Number 8387 Judge s Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact 20 to conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously regardless of 20 whether he was intoxicated to some degree when he set fire to the victims 20 home Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte r 20 the fire his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o n 20 the night of the fire The testimony indicated that even if defendant was 20 intoxicated he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif ic 20 intent The evidence established that 1 defendant appeared at the victims 20 home three times and was there purposely prior to the fire 2 defendant h ad 20 no reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims house 3 20 defendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them and 4 20 defendant followed through with the threats later that night when he 20 purchased kerosene transported it to the victims home poured it onto the 20 porch and into the mail slot and set fire to the home Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for 20 aiding and abetting false pretenses attempted false pretenses and stealin g 20 or retaining a financial transaction device Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Pitts e Journal Number 8395 Judge s Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan There was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave 20 encouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his 20 convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false 20 pretenses Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger 20 door of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police the credit card numbe rs 20 recovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card 20 numbers given by defendant s brother to purchase merchandise There was no 20 evidence associating defendant with the representations that were made to t he 20 employees by his brother regarding the validity of the credit card numbers 20 Defendant s convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempt ed 20 false pretenses were reversed 20 Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Suppression of defendant s inculpatory statements Whether 20 interrogation was custodial Whether defendant s statements were knowingly 20 and voluntarily made Totality of the circumstances Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Rose e Journal Number 8385 Judge s Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court erred in suppressing defendant s statements to police on th e 20 basis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings 20 from the outset of the interview Defendant agreed to speak with the police 20 drove himself to the station and was informed prior to the interview that he 20 was not under arrest and was free to leave At no time was he told that he 20 was not free to leave and the door was left open The officer s failure to 20 tell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac t 20 that defendant was told he was free to leave or render the interview a 20 custodial one Further under the totality of the circumstances defendant s 20 statements were knowingly and voluntarily made and were not the product of 20 psychological coercion Defendant was 21 years old had completed three yea rs 20 of college and discerned the focus of the officer s inquiries soon after t he 20 interview began The trial court s order suppressing defendant s statements 20 was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Prosecutorial misconduct Other acts evidence Admission of witness 20 testimony Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Vaughn e Journal Number 8383 Judge s Per Curiam O Connell Kelly and Whitbeck Although the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an 20 accomplice s plea agreement to bolster that witness testimony defendant d id 20 not show that he was prejudiced The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc t 20 by eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the 20 witness to testify truthfully because the prosecutor did not personally 20 vouch for the witness credibility Affirmed Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Modification of a custody order without conducting an evidentiary 20 hearing Trial court s failure to identify the change of circumstances 20 whether an established custodial environment existed or an analysis of the 20 best interest factors Reassignment of custody matter to a different judge Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Belgiorno v Belgiorno e Journal Number 8389 Judge s Per Curiam Wilder Smolenski and Whitbeck The trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing 20 before it entered an order modifying the parties custody The trial court s 20 order placing physical custody of the parties minor child with 20 plaintiff mother was vacated and remanded to 1 conduct an evidentiary 20 hearing 2 state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the 20 record 3 determine whether an established custodial environment existed 20 4 determine whether proper cause or a change of

Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo 19b 3 a ii c i 20 g and j Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing Failure t o 20 challenge one of the statutory grounds for termination Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Glover e Journal Number 8379 Judge s Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for 20 termination of respondent mother s parental rights were established by clea r 20 and convincing evidence Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment 20 plan until approximately one month before the termination hearings Further 20 while she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug 20 testing she failed to do either Since respondent made no significant 20 progress in these areas and considering her past history respondent s 20 parental rights were properly terminated under oo 19b 3 c i g and j 20 Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also

s 20 ability to pay support where there was an existing support order Appointme nt 20 of counsel in a stepparent adoption Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Keller e Journal Number 8378 Judge s Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The termination of respondent father s parental rights was reversed because 20 the trial court erred by finding that o 51 6 a was satisfied on the basis 20 that respondent had the ability to pay child support and failed to do so I t 20 was improper for the trial court to inquire into respondent s ability to pa y 20 child support under o 51 6 a where there was an existing support order T he 20 order that reserved the question of support because respondent was 20 incarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th e 20 ability to pay The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel fo r 20 respondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding und er 20 o 51 6 a the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indige nt 20 nonconsenting parent Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Standing Case or controversy Absence of an injury in fact 20 Challenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme Standard of 20 review Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v Michigan 20 Gaming Control Bd Court U S Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Barden Detroit Casino L L C v The City of Detroit e Journal Number 8399 Judge s Nelson Moore and Wilhoit The district court correctly dismissed plaintiff s suit against both the ci ty 20 and state defendants because plaintiff an unsuccessful bidder for a licens e 20 to operate a Detroit casino lacked standing The court in Lac Vieux 20 previously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred 20 developers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tie breaking 20 preference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi no 20 gambling in Detroit had been eliminated Since the preference was 20 ineffective there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th e 20 state defendants in regard to the state statute As to the city defendants 20 the mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta ge 20 of the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been 20 eliminated from the competition Therefore the preference was never applie d 20 to plaintiff s detriment and plaintiff suffered no actual injury Affirmed Full Text Opinion Malpractice Back to Quicklinks Issues Medical

Unpublished Case Name Cabell v Carino e Journal Number 8382 Judge s Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court properly granted defendant orthopedist summary disposition on 20 the grounds that plaintiff s pre suit notice was not filed within two years 20 of the act or omission that was the basis of the claim While plaintiff s 20 claim accrued in March 1995 he did not file a notice of intent to sue unti l 20 June 1997 Plaintiff s assertion that he did not discover his claim until h e 20 received his medical records from defendant in April 1997 was without merit 20 Plaintiff s deposition testimony established that by June 1995 at the 20 latest he was aware of a problem with his toe following defendant s 20 treatment for an ankle fracture and actually believed that the cast 20 defendant placed on his ankle and foot had caused the problem Plaintiff s 20 attorney was investigating his claim in October 1995 Plaintiff s claim tha t 20 defendant s failure to produce plaintiff s medical records in response to h is 20 request excused the timely filing of the notice of intent also failed 20 Affirmed Full Text Opinion Worker s Compensation Back to Quicklinks Issues Claim for weekly wage loss benefits based on mental disability The 20 Gardner formulation of the statutory test for determining whether an employ ee 20 has suffered a compensable mental disability The Worker s Compensation 20 Appellate Commission WCAC Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name White v Department of Agric e Journal Number 8393 Judge s Per Curiam Owens Jansen and Burns The magistrate properly determined that although an incident where 20 plaintiff s supervisor kicked him to wake plaintiff up after he nodded off on 20 the job may have appeared objectively insignificant to the average person 20 there was substantial evidence from plaintiff s physician establishing that 20 because it would not take much of a stimulus to trigger a response in a 20 patient with a preexisting borderline personality the kicking incident 20 contributed to aggravated or accelerated plaintiff s mental condition in a 20 significant manner All that is statutorily required are actual events of 20 employment even if objectively unimportant that contribute to aggravate 20 or accelerate a mental disability in a significant manner The decision of 20 the WCAC reversing the magistrate and denying plaintiff s claim for weekly 20 wage loss benefits on the basis of a mental disability was reversed and 20 remanded the case for reinstatement of the magistrate s award Full Text Opinion

ENRON DEVELOPMENT John Novak SA Enron Enron Mark E Haedicke HOU ECT ECT Subject Re Elektro s telecom project For what it is worth I agree with Sami s concern that we may laboring under a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in a Brazilian contract between Brazilian contracting parties relating to a Brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a Brazilian court Inevitably we have to fight hard for these concessions in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration not to mention blood and sweat on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts If we are really being taken by these crafty Brazilian lawyers like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I think we should re think the policy in this specific instance Elektro because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts we had a number of cases you will recall when we bought it and have had others since It is clearly not the only substantial high profile Brazilian company Enron has down here making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as foreigners the way we do elsewhere By all means we should check with Jose Emilio but if he shares Sami s and I have to say my concerns I think we should consider making a special rule for Brazil to Brazil contracting transactions Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo in English with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts federal if possible of Sao Paulo The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision thinking we are safe and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice due process etc If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions let me know Randy Sami Arap 01 10 2001 06 20 AM To Robert C Williams ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT cc Michelle Blaine ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT margalith elektro com br Randy Young ENRON DEVELOPMENT Rob Walls ENRON DEVELOPMENT Subject Re Elektro s telecom project Thanks again Bob I will call Jos Emilio to check I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil whether international or local aspects are under discussion provided that you follow the exequatur procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago However the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with Article 88 I II III of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code In such event if Enron please note that I am always only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in S o Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and at the same time or at a later stage one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void I will be in Houston on Friday January 26 and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls and or Jim Derrick Regards Sami Robert C Williams ENRON DEVELOPMENT 01 09 2001 10 18 PM To Sami Arap SA Enron ENRON cc Michelle Blaine ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT margalith elektro com br ENRON Randy Young Rob Walls Subject Re Elektro s telecom project Sami I agree on the issue of Brazilian law But on the question of foreign arbitration our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec As to local arbitration we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than 500 000 We should probably also have a cumulative cap of say 5 million On bigger deals Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more is at stake is to agree to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo In this case I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award whether that be ad hoc ICC FIESP or Canadian Brazilian C of C Jose Emilio would have a view on this too Hope this is helpful Bob Sami Arap ENRON 01 09 2001 04 48 PM To Michelle Blaine ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Robert C Williams ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT cc margalith elektro com br Subject Re Elektro s telecom project Michelle and Bob Thanks for the reply The issue here is when Brazilian entities only are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy and please correct me if I am wrong is that when Enron as a foreign company is dealing with foreign governments governmental agencies or government owned companies or private companies from the host company we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law In case of Elektro as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity EAS ECE etc entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil the contracting parties must comply with local public policy I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism we are all aware of Enron s policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in S o Paulo To me the question is whether we use ad hoc arbitration OR institutional arbitration i e submit the matter to FIESP or the Canadian Brazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the arbitration administrator FYI since I joined Enron I ve been told that all of Enron s Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts dispute resolution mechanism In my opinion this concept may not work the way Enron wants If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and suppose both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY it is most likely that in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case You may ask why The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction I d very much like to emphasize that while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that at the end of the day I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts Since Odebrecht s counterparties did not do their homework properly Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of 1824 The Civil Code of 1916 ractified the use of arbitration however it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts Only in 1996 with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act Law 9307 it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts With respect to enforceability please note that the arbitral award is final binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an exequatur Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter Rgds Sami Robert C Williams ENRON DEVELOPMENT 01 09 2001 03 55 PM To Michelle Blaine ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT cc Sami Arap SA Enron ENRON Subject Re Elektro s telecom

Rob Milnthorp CAL ECT ECT mhb blakes com Subject Security under Master Agreements Mark Rob Milnthorp has asked me to consider whether there is an artful way under our Master Agreements that upon certain occurrences we could elevate our exposure from unsecured to secured particularly in circumstances where for whatever reason we have not received letters of credit or other collateral My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the nature of a floating charge The problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the industry For example certain counterparties i e a financial institution or a near financial institution such as a bank a brokerage a trading institution etc would not likely be willing to provide us with security over their assets In general counterparties will also have concerns with granting security over their assets particularly as that security may have restricting consequences for their treasury banking relationships and covenants and or on their ability to conduct business including disposing of assets which may then require our consent In addition it would likely be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis such that it would also be binding on us in similar circumstances Counterparties could go so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp guarantees For example in the natural gas business in Canada at least older form marketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas producers used reserved dedication covenants whereby reserves were dedicated to a particular contract These covenants did not however create security to avoid the complicating issues addressed above To the extent that the reserves were not available the marketer aggregator could have a claim on an unsecured basis for breach of covenant but was not in a secured position I do not believe we want to go to this type of concept However we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the counterparty is free to deal with us and we are free to deal with them on an unsecured basis subject to our standard collateralization requirements but also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event such as a Material Adverse Change a Triggering Event an Event of Default etc the security automatically takes place We would need to consider whether such a prospective security interest could be made to work and be enforceable I have discussed this concept on a preliminary basis with Rob Milnthorp and Mungo Hardwicke Brown of the Blake firm to see if we could create a relatively simple clause to be inserted into our Master Agreements which artfully deals with this issue In essence the idea would be to get ourselves in a position of being one step ahead of all of the unsecured creditors in the event there is an insolvency Would you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project or whether we have considered such a thing in the past in Houston As noted above the clause would have to be one that could be sold to counterparties and be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis and that may well not be possible If you believe that it is a worthwhile project I will continue to work with Mungo Hardwicke Brown to see if we can come up with something If you do not believe that it is a worthwhile project or have considered this idea in the past and found it to be unworkable please let me know and we will not work on it further Regards Peter ","recipient_address":"peter.keohane@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-11-07

brief overview of the reviews this past week of eLaw and eVelocity eLaw I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week The reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron to the tune of 10MM to 15MM The secondary focus was on the product and its usefulness to Enron Steve made it clear that any funding decision would be driven 100 by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and thus it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go The demonstration of the tool was impressive Though it does act as a traditional shopping type site in many respects it also has functionality to create a myelaw page customized to the information you the user are the most interested in seeing It also allows for a query into further information which query is then forwarded to the law firms or firm supporting the practice area e g Labor Employment for comment There is also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded organized and maintained including legal opinions memoranda on various topics and form pleadings documents This area is secure from the balance of the site so that other users cannot access the information The loading process is fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment Some of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a new version coming out early Q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas available Right now the focus is on Environmental Intellectual Property Health Care and Tax I think the tool could be useful especially in relation to the organization of information we obtain from our outside sources It may also complement the website portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the website portal development process I would be curious to see however what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function eVelocity I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs sp to discuss the eVelocity tool It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm and our legal department solely for the movement review and payment of law firm invoices While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a matter management system it can itself be used as a matter management tool The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of rules that are applicable to law firm invoices For example say Enron does not pay more than 0 10 per page of copying This can be set as a rule so that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than this amount per page would be automatically rejected The rejection would then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to the system This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review but notes that it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney is alerted to the issue The system does identify the problem so you do not have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules It is possible to establish rules that would allow an invoice presuming it complied with all rules to be automatically approved and moved to AP for payment This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system but it could be done In addition to the above functionality the system can also track matters budgets for matters costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter Reports can be generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters Finally since it is a web browser based system implementation is not difficult and there is not a lot of IT involvement needed I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed and received the response that there really is no such need Mike indicated a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp portal website it makes sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking Whether or not it is eVelocity or another comparable tool would require further research into the available products but I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere What I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings surrounding the demonstrations If either of you would like further information or have any

Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known quantity though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier Ken said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a free market approach to energy and metals However there is some concern about his ability to reign in the CFTC staff Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep Jerry Moran R KS However it is still early in the game and unknown Chair candidates could still be out there including officials passed over for more high profile positions If Newsome is nominated as the Chair an additional Commissioner a Republican position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago exchanges may influence the appointment Stacy Carey is poking around to determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking One name that has been mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest in a Commission seat but not the Chair Ewing is supportive of our issues David Spears is also likely to leave but no date has been announced This is also a Republican seat The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expire We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or join the Commission Also we have learned

I could recruit someone with 4 6 years major law firm experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial experience Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level but I was able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing If he proves unsatisfactory I will then have to go to an out placement recruitment agency which is relatively expensive That said the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process His name is Derek Flaman I will send his resume to you by fax A couple of points Strengths a Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is a highly regarded commercial associate b Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial associate there The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him c Derek has never done any work for us but I have met him socially a number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility I think he has a down to earth and comfortable personality that would suit the atmosphere and stresses of Enron well d Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil one of DEY s major Calgary clients for a period and has experince in house He worked for an internal lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent reviews e Although I do not have his law school grades he tells me he finished in the top third of his class at Queens University which among the reputable schools in Canada f He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law g He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston both of whom were favorably impressed Issues a Derek graduated from law school in 94 and since that time his career has been a bit traveled Although there is an explanation his continuous experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in 97 Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta After graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest in labor law and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor boutique After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out Toronto and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton His wife then took a position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however and so he moved to Macleod Dixon in Calgary He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established their office in Calgary All things being considered I am comfortable with his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level although compensation could then be an issue I have not discussed compensation with him b Derek s experience has been primarily in large commercial projects especially the off shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova for Husky This would require some very good legal and large project organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced commercially oriented higher volume trading atmosphere In his secondment to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and natural gas marketing and although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys c Do Jim Derrick s accounting law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer as opposed to retaining counse I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps interview in Houston with whom Vicki Sharp get a feel for compensation

confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed earlier this year The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor its agreements Look at Davis s spin on breaching contract provisions State negotiators worried little about the confidentiality clauses in their haste to sign the contracts but now administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long term contracts From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking long term contracts once prices go down in a year or two We didn t think a lot about the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the lights on But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment clause On another note thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday I am

work hard to continue to add value and keep your confidence Best regards Steve Davis to divulge details of costly energy buys By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO Amid mounting attacks on Gov Gray Davis energy crisis secrecy administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin revealing full details of the state s costly last minute power purchases aimed at thwarting blackouts The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it will start disclosing information on the initial multimillion dollar purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January In doing so the administration will begin honoring Davis promise to reveal the details after a period of six months or less The governor said disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down power costs But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from open government advocates consumer activists Republican lawmakers and others GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits under the state s Public Records Act seeking disclosure of details on about 8 billion in emergency short term purchases and additional billions on less costly years long contracts A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the lawsuits today in San Diego On Thursday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on Californians to phone the governor s office in protest The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is getting it said Harvey Rosenfield the group s director The governor won t let us look at them contracts to make sure they won t cause further rate hikes in future years Rosenfield said It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts he said We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions Administration officials dismissed critics assertions and said that full disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive marketing matter Officials acknowledged for the first time however that some of the state s less costly long term power contracts with generators contain secrecy clauses that may prevent public disclosure The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less expensive long term power supplies that authorities worried little about the clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have the suppliers permission to divulge them Though violating the agreement could void the contracts industry representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts Suppliers might however sign no more contracts with the state the representatives said Apparently there are some contracts with that secrecy clause and our legal people are looking at it said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio I don t know what the end result is going to be but it s the governor s intent to release the contracts While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long term contracts they said disclosure of the initial short term purchases will soon begin Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of short term spot market buys made in mid January within the next two weeks on the Internet easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis fellow Democratic statewide elected officials State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state power bills in February during a dramatic 11th hour reversal under pressure from the Davis administration The controller who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administration s handling of the energy crisis indefinitely postponed plans to put information from electricity purchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a news conference to announce the disclosures In March Attorney General Bill Lockyer representing Davis in this instance provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases Lockyer s letter said the public s interest in maintaining confidentiality in matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure But Lockyer a former East Bay politician said last week he personally favors making public the details of the purchases In my mind at least and as a matter of philosophy the expenditures are so extraordinary the issues are so important that the contracts need to be made public he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of Information Coalition Open government advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of 10 Californians believe they are getting too little information about how state officials are responding to the power shortage and a whopping 86 percent want details of long term power purchasing contracts made public Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the state s Open Government Act said Kent Pollock the coalition s executive director The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that shield information from public scrutiny

in discussions with FCEL on that draft but nothing has been signed 3 Disclosure Discussions I will also send you under separate email the initial draft of the talking points for the disclosure discusison It is new and has not been discussed internally yet 4 Contracts Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL s counsel Kay Mann is handling the State side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be 5 Regulatory Filings There will be no filings required with respect to the purchase of the equity unless we have to file a Sched 13D which will depend upon the timing of the option vesting My gut reaction is that we will probably need to file the 13D but it is a routine filing I do not know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and again request Kay to please advise us on that It seems to me thay we should

Hemstock CAL ECT ECT Sharon Crawford CAL ECT ECT Subject Retail Initiative Mark I am following up with you regarding legal support for this matter Mark P is dedicated to this project and getting up the learning curve by focusing his time on understanding the regulatory statutory licensing requirements for a retail affiliate for Alberta electricity We hope to have a recommendation shortly on an action plan for the regulatory compliance requirements a recommendation on contracting forms separate commercial and residential consumer forms and to begin drafting forms However as discussed outside counsel legal support will be required i to set up register the retail entity to do business subject to confirmation of the outstanding structuring issue on which I await an answer ii confirm all regulatory statutory licensing requirements for a retail affiliate iii review and advise on contracting forms and iv take an advocacy position for us at upcoming regulatory hearings In this regard we had agreed to talk to Stikeman Elliott about representation It turns out the Stikemans has an unresolveable conflict as it acts for Enmax the City of Calgary s retail affiliate and a direct competitor From asking around it also seems that any of the firms which have may have experience in the developing retail market have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in direct conflict as well ex Bennet Jones Atco Canadian Utilities Macleod Dixon and McCarthy Tetrault TransAlta Burnet Duckworth City of Calgary Enmax City of Medicine Hat Borden Ladner Gervais EPCOR many of whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event It seems to me that the available alternatives are Blake Cassels Graydon and Osler Hoskin Harcourt neither of whom to my specific knowledge have specific expertise in this area However as noted those with any actual or purported expertise tend for that reason to be conflicted Accordingly my suggestion is that I speak to Blakes to see what expertise they have but likely nonetheless retain them assuming there is no conflict on the basis of their general capabilities and their understanding and commitment to Enron At the end of the day even if there is a learning curve it is seemingly learnable and inevitable Please let me know if you have a problem as we need to move quickly to get on with the project To confirm you were going to let me know how we should proceed with structuring the affiliate liability vs tax efficiency which may be affected by how and if EES participates Once the ball is rolling on the Alberta electricity

real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate The Energy Provisions discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated Contrary to this release s statement no House member other than one member who didn t make it for the vote Congressman Baker is asking for changes in the Senate The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves All and all this press release is

HOUSE PASSAGE OF H R 4541 NEW YORK NY October 20 2000 In response to passage by the House of Representatives last night of H R 4541 the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport issued the following statement The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregious that by approving subsection g 3 of Section 106 the House would not only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutiny and regulatory oversight but also do this in a fashion that discriminates between established markets versus start up electronic forums It is particularly outrageous at a time when every U S consumer is feeling the impact of high energy prices to allow lobbying by a small group of vested interests to influence Congress to take these markets out of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade on private proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutral self regulatory organization Policy makers regulators and the American public will be deprived of currently available information on market participation concentration and financial performance This is not only a matter of ill conceived public policy but is also anti competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made by the President sWorking Group on financial markets Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publicly quoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senate level to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amended to create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcry markets ","recipient_address":"cynthia.sandherr@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-10-20

Request for help Dear Mark I hope you are doing well You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkett regarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program There has apparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board and our board Any proposal has to make its way through the Children s Services Committee then the Executive Committee It is then put before the whole board for a vote I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEAR representatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children s Committee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review and decision a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who are not directly involved with the BEAR program I also thought you could give this advice without having to commit a great deal of time including travel time for meetings I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should be supportive of such public private partnerships There is probably some difference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support and at what pace we should give the program I would deeply appreciate your helping the BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible I

understanding that many participants want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a next to final form for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our form become the industry standard Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the differences Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in developing the form Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is November 9th My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a Canadianized version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting point Apparently EEI will also be in attendance I will follow up with Elizabeth Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US experience in

reported on the status of link identification Discussion took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with the links and those links that will be useful to the Department realizing that few clients will actual access our site for links Work on a listing of categories and sites for these categories will continue General Information Subsequent to our meeting I met with our designated IT project coordinator Tamika Hebert We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we want in the site Unfortunately John Reese our IT designer was out of the office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date I hope to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available to everyone for comment I also provided Tamika with references to some of the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of the look feel and functionality we want Concerning actual development of the background structure the programmer has not been identified for this project but should be by the end of this week Once he she is identified work will begin on the design of the functionality of the site Concurrent with this

have sent relating to this agreement I hope that this will be the last as far as asking for input Over the last few days the form of the paper pursuant to which Enron Canada will trade physical power in Canada has been reviewed and I think finalized by legal in Calgary and Houston and the commercial people in Calgary We have determined that it is in the best interest of Enron to jointly promote the Edison Electric Institute EEI form of master which as I described in my e mail of yesterday consists of a standardized base contract with an amending section much like the ISDA form of financial master However as the current form of the EEI master is a US document containing many US specific provisions that have no application in Canada commercially it has been identified as a concern that with respect to counterparties that are not sophisticated trading companies selling a US document with a Canadian addendum will be difficult if not impossible Therefore we are going to proceed to finalize the form of industrial master that I have drafted and sent out numerous times for review a copy of which I enclose in both a clean and black lined version black lined to the most recent draft distributed to you in what I now believe is in fact final form Our commercial people can use this form together with the form of GTC I distributed to most of you earlier today to market power in Alberta to counterparties who will not accept the EEI form We will immediately begin the process of supporting the use of the EEI form in Canada but will propose that a Canadian form of base contract be agreed to and implemented thereby eliminating the problem of using a US document as the base contract for Canadian transactions I will begin the process of trying to create a first draft of this base contract which other than with respect to removing US references and incorporating specific Canadian principles will be identical to the US form I will also commence the process of preparing what Enron believes the form of addendum to this Canadian base contract should be Sorry for the lengthy e mail but I wanted to ensure that everyone was completely up to date with the status and process I believe that this solution will address everyone s concerns without jeopardizing commercial transactions in Alberta Thanks Greg ","recipient_address":"greg.johnston@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-11-03

opportunity to ask for donations as well as offer volunteer opportunities 3 Partner with the Enron Cycling Club to donate bikes leverage their connections with local bike stores These employees might be more likely to want to donate 2 Utilize Matching Dollars up to 15 000 per employee annually if Mark or other employees are interested in contributing Additionally if Mark or other employees

Milnthorp CAL ECT ECT Subject Plan B Auction Need for Approvals Mark thanks for the voice mail In terms of a risk memo I agree that one should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master Agreement and without an outlay of capital but hopefully the following together with my memo from last night copy attached suffices to the extent a risk memo is required In terms of unusual risks 1 We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master However the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially Government of Alberta credit risk Derek Davies is I believe dealing with Credit to resolve credit issues In fact I believe the Balancing Pool is taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds 2 The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental guarantee of Enron Corp and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron Corp s creditworthiness 3 It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into back to back physical hedges for 70 of the volume we acquire and we are currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding and being successful in the auction Penalties can be imposed if 70 of the volume purchased is not properly hedged 4 As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta we always run the risk as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired in the first auction that they can change the auction rules the market rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us In terms of the auction rules as with the first auction they could be better drafted but our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back and to ensure that the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete control of whether or not we can comply with the rules Peter Milly sorry for not copying you on my first memo see

AECO index In other words our best argument is likely that CGPR cannot pass off what it purports to be an AECO index reflecting the broader market but NGX and EOL for that matter are free to publish their own index The result might be that NGX or EOL for that matter is free to publish their own index provided it is not passed of as being the CGPR AECO index reflecting the broader market and Enerdata then must publish the broader index if it wishes as the CGPR AECO index However if CGPR chose not to continue publishing it is likely going to be free to do so with the effect that there would be no CGPR AECO index as referred to in our Confirms and Transactions which would have to then be altered to account for a separate and new index which for the time being could be NGX or EOL I

the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Late Friday afternoon December 15 Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act CEA and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions By enacting such changes Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron s further product innovation and growth Specifically the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over the counter OTC bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation Bilateral Transactions Under the Act bilateral transactions in all commodities other than agriculture commodities that do not occur on trading facility i e not on a multi party exchange are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between eligible contract participants i e persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth Multilateral Transactions In addition the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement contract or transaction in commodities other than agriculture commodities so long as they the transactions are between eligible commercial participants are entered into on a principle to principle basis and that take place on a multi party electronic facility This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi party transactions however certain legal requirements will have to be met Other Transactions The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron including credit risk measure commodities and weather derivatives Again the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in

that there were 4 categories for low risk jurisdictions and only 3 categories for each of medium and high risk jurisdictions Maybe we cannot have a no legal risk in a high risk jurisdiction but what about many significant legal issues in a medium risk jurisdiction Is this then too many categories Also would it make any sense to have ratings of 1 through 4 only with a requirement to specify whether we are dealing with a low medium or high risk jurisdiction In other words could anyone be confused into believing that a rating of 4 is better than a rating of a 5 As currently set forth a higher rating does not necessarily equate to a greater risk Unless a reader were very familiar with the rating scale someone might interpret a low number out of say 10 as having minimal risk when ratings 4 7 and 10 may actually be the worst As for the OGC and Legal Committee I note only that Dan and Lisa would no longer be on the LC How do you think we would convey this to them Also I was

Fidelity came back and said they re not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely The way the deal w Fidelity will be structured ENA will pay them the delta between the 5 2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close est to be 300K Fidelity wants 2 things protection in the event the IRS disallows disqualifies the tax credits accrued i e the 300K and protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI June 200 thru Jan 2001 There are 2 basic alternatives to consider replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a specific cap on the tax credit amount 300K and with the same environmental coverage up to 5MM as currently exists but restricting it to issues which occurred while they were a partner The probability of either ever being triggered is extremely remote Replacing the benefactor from LGI to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides Fidelity with the same protection as alternative 1 Per ENA accounting since the amount of exposure is limited to 5 3MM in aggregate this would not be significant material enough to be separately identified as a balance sheet item The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty in hand and unless you give me approval to go back and structure our deal around them we don t have any leverage to get them to release it They are willing to work with us on either of the 2 alternatives listed above This is the only remaining commercial issue left w Fidelity Please advise or

posting the collateral and that we do not sign the indemnity agreement This recommendation assumes that we want to continue to do some residual business with the CalPX Obviously if our traders don t care about doing any business with them we should just call their bluff and quit trading with them but I don t think we would really want to do this The reason why I do not think we should sign the indemnity agreement is because it exposes us Enron Corp to the very real PX credit meltdown risk Under the PX s Surety Bond with AIG if creditors of the CalPX say the big three California Utilities for example teetering as they are on the brink of insolvency were to default to the PX then AIG must keep the CalPX whole If AIG pays any money to the PX it will immediately turn to its indemnity agreements with all the non defaulting participants including ours and try to recover from them Although the indemnity agreements purport to limit AIG s ability to recover from us to our own specific default with the PX I do not think we should rely on the wording of the agreement to guarantee that we would not be washed into some kind of broader claim by AIG in a meltdown situation The wording is too ambiguous If I were outside counsel I would not write us a legal opinion saying that if we signed the indemnity agreement we would not have any exposure in a meltdown Therefore given the solvency crisis with the big three utilities I think we should assume there will be a major payment default and I think if we must continue to do business with the PX we should do it on the basis of posting collateral for our exposure Such collateral would be clearly tied to our own default and we should be able to control our own default risk with them I have asked Tracy to set up a conference call to go over this reasoning cgy ","recipient_address":"christian.yoder@enron.com","sent_time":"2001-01-04

we thought that Only upon the parties mutually agreement would the use of a qualified independent expert arbitrator subject to AAA rules note the current language in the draft would need to be changed to clarify that AAA rules would apply to the IE s proceedings be the appropriate mechanism for the expeditious handling of a narrow group of technical disputes Technical Disputes Primarily these would be disputes over the adjustment of the contract price for a change order or the date of a milestone or completion date due a change order In the interests of an expeditious resolution the current draft should be changed to reflect that the IE s decisions would be final and non appealable as contrasted with the current draft where in certain instances they can be appealed to the three arbitrator panel The baseball arbitration approach required in the current draft should be used by the IE for these Technical Disputes only and would not apply to disputes handled by the three arbitrator Panel The commercial people on the Enron LNG side of the table like baseball arbitration b c they believe it mitigates the possibility of claims inflation by the Contractor in these change order price disputes All other disputes under the Contract would be handled by a three arbitrator panel Panel subject to AAA rules which would also handle all Technical Disputes if the parties cannot

Change to standard ISDA Schedule Dear All In the course of current ISDA Master Agreement negotiations with an Australian counterparty it has come to my attention that the ISDA netting opinion for Australia specifies that certain Sections of the ISDA Master should not be altered otherwise reliance on the opinion and close out netting could be jeopardised In particular the opinion specifies that Section 2 a iii should not be altered Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2 a iii in Part 5 of its standard form Schedule viz a Conditions Precedent The condition precedent set forth in clause 1 of Section 2 a iii shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section 2 a i and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations whether absolute or contingent under Section 2 a i Obviously in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent should not be included in our documentation In addition there are a number of other countries including Germany Italy South Korea and Switzerland where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master including Section 2 a iii are not altered in any material respect To that end I would suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with counterparties trading from these jurisdictions Certainly from the London end I think that when we start negotiations with a new counterparty we should check the ISDA

facility is currently scheduled to be sold to Cinergy Capital Trading Inc The anticipated closing date is March 27 2001 but this is subject to change depending on when we obtain the requisite regulatory approval One of the things that ENA was seeking to do prior to deciding to sell the plant was to establish a second interconnection to the Southern Company currently Caledonia is interconnected to TVA In pursuit of this second interconnection certain ENA developers were charged with the responsibility for obtaining options for easements The easements were needed in order to run the transmission wires from the plant to the point of the interconnection with Southern To date we have obtained all but one of the required options the Galiano Option We are obligated to cooperate with Cinergy from now until the closing date in pursuit of the Galiano Option Ms Galiano and her lawyer have insisted upon adding an indemnity in the form of easement which requires the grantee Caledonia Power I LLC to indemnify the grantor against liabilities arising from grantee s use of the easement They have adamantly rejected however my request that the indemnification be limited to actual damages and that special consequential and punitive damages be waived Cinergy has asked us to execute the Galiano Option without the waiver of consequential damages and I am seeking your permission to do so I think that this should be acceptable from ENA s perspective for several reasons 1 It is likely 99 that we sell Caledonia Power I LLC the proposed counterparty to the Galiano Option in the next several weeks 2 The Galiano Option is structured as an option to obtain an easement and the waiver of consequential damages issue only arises if the option is actually exercised and 3 If for some odd reason the sale doesn t go through we finally decide to complete the second interconnection and we exercise the option for easement we can probably mitigate our risk by procuring additional insurance Please let me know at your earliest possible convenience if I may proceed with the execution of the Galiano Option Many thanks Stuart

and you I told Dan politely that I am very tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add I hope that is OK with you To be honest I am really tired of talking to the issue and dealing with Dan Fournier s political maneuvering but I am also concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron I have lost trust and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan s approach within Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes resources to our files He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates the talent within his firm I know for a fact after he has squeezed others out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron that if Dan is back in the saddle many of his partners will not been keen on doing our work under Dan s terms I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to commercial people not having say in legal retainers but I believe that the senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market have an important place in the relationship and in that regard I know Fournier has lost the trust and confidence of Rob Milnthorp 2 Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young it should be borne in mind that the initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and Morris Clark on the tax side I also know Jordan thinks well not just of their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model I also think that Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away and likely to expand in Canada the US and Europe and is something we likely cannot ignore Also the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail market where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary We first approached Stikemans which had conflict with Enmax and Bennett Jones which had a conflict with ATCO Other firms which we do not typically use but which had experience also had conflicts After that I solicited written propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail team Frankly DEY has done good work for us E Y is also very well situated on the market development

Enron also owns and interest although I do not know how much We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund I am not sure but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my

the second and third if they make it to the Western Conference Finals but I assume that doesn t matter we should assume that a commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games 549 per seat or 2 196 total That s two games in Round 1 at 88 50 per ticket and four games in Round 2 at 93 00 per ticket Rounds 3 and 4 which we wouldn t have to pay for until later are 916 per seat or 3 664 I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games For the regular season I had 6 44 of the tickets which is 13 6 That s approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4 I d be glad to spring for that although if you all want all the playoff tickets that s fine also So I suppose how much it s going to cost each of you depends on whether my ticket is Round 1 or 2 If it s in round 2 each of you would pay 912 for the first two rounds and if it s in round 1 each of you would pay 921 If the two of you want all the playoff tickets each of you would pay 1 098 for Rounds 1 and 2 This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can ask for a refund by the same means that you paid So what I would propose to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don t make the playoffs that charge will be reversed and it may not even make it on my bill if they don t make the playoffs Since I will put it on my card I won t need your money until about the 20th of April So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds I m fine either way

reviewed in detail our trading contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in California In order to reduce Enron s non market risks e g legal credit and regulatory in the volatile commodity markets in California or any future California we propose the following changes 1 Mandatory Uniform Set Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities set off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts Set off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set off and not just the least common denominator 2 Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty a bridge should be put in place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters 3 Merge EPMI into ENA power trades are done through EPMI Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view 4 No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event in the PGE SCE situation it should be the non defaulting party s Enron in this case option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on inability to pay debts as they become due Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading I believe these changes will i improve efficiency ii reduce risks iii develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and iv substantially improve Enron s

opportunities for Enron Mark Sami Arap ENRON 04 16 2001 08 34 AM To Mark E Haedicke HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Re Financial Trading in Brazil Mark The Brazilian Central Bank created a structure of access to the interest rate currency and commodity swaps international market that is based on 3 main points as follows payments and receipts arising from hedging modes trading on the offshore stock market as well as on the forward futures and option markets as well as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions spread commissions premiums and so on will be effected in foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market remittances intended for the opening of current accounts with brokerage companies abroad as well as for deposits of collateral margins are permitted and upon preliminary approval by the Central Bank remittances abroad intended for collateral and escrow deposits linked to interest rate and currency swaps can be effected The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual normal and necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced by 100 In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions from these operations the spread commissions premiums and other related sums when remitted abroad will not be subject to any income tax withholdings With respect to the tax treatment of losses that Brazilian companies may incur as a result of hedging operations such losses may be deductible for the purpose of determining taxable profits only in the event that they occur in investments on exchanges abroad If these transactions are not carried out on such exchanges the losses will not be deductible when determining the taxable profits Brazilian entities are not prevented to enter into swap or other derivative transactions on the international market in case they do not meet the requirements established above The consequences however will be the following payments and receipts arising from such transactions as well as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions could not be effected in foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market but only through mechanisms available in the or related to the floating or tourism exchange rate the inflow of foreign currency through the floating rate market would be subject to IOF tax on financial transactions assessed at the rate of 2 on the Brazilian currency equivalent of the foreign funds

request on which I d like your approval I am involved with a potential power plant development project with the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida The project would be on their land and would

with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general In fact Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled Energy Business in Indian Country Opportunities and

in British Columbia are settled against the Inside F E R C Sumas Index Inside F E R C is now requiring that in addition to pure trading data we must also provide counterparty identification On the basis that we cannot provide that counterparty identification both due to contractual obligations and business policies practices our information was excluded from the Sumas Index for the last index period I know for example in negotiating the settlement with NGX that the provision of counterparty identification was a matter of very serious concern particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL However I am advised by Jon McKay that notwithstanding these apparent contractual restrictions and business policies practices Houston provides counterparty identifications to Inside F E R C The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index which is particularly problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point On the other hand if we do provide counterparty identification we run the risk of breaching confidentiality obligations business policies practices and upsetting our trading counterparties I guess we have two alternatives one is to continue to not disclose counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F E R C will change its view on this although as I mentioned their position is that Houston provides them with that information or provide counterparty identifications at the risk of getting offside our counterparties My preference would be to do the former but I

fight us on the arbitrability of the Guaranty Agreement claim We could end up with two proceedings our arbitration and a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim Unfortunately El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the Guaranty Agreement claim Fourth El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality provision I think they would have a good argument that we have breached that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc to people outside the company such as our bankers I am not clear what damages they could claim based on that alleged breach I haven t heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El Paso to assert but we haven t done much investigating in that area either I suppose if El Paso got

More Than One Year Contracts Mark Got your voice mail on this I wasn t sure if you were suggesting the policy for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year My thoughts are as follows 1 Policy Scope I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to trading as well as origination transactions As you know often there is a very blurry line 2 Existing Masters If a master is in place confirmations will be used for terms of one month to greater than one year I don t think it will be practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there are material modifications done to the pre approved confirmation template in the master which would require Legal approval in the present state of affairs I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated contracts outside a Master Agreement 3 Order of Magnitude We should consider having a dollar figure determined simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or the Enron financial commitment amount coupled with the one year or greater term that would require the additional OGC AGC approval in order to make sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts I would be happy to discuss this with you further Alan ","recipient_address":"alan.aronowitz@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-10-26

Subject Chinese Wall Policy final version Enclosed please find redlined and clean copies of the versions of Executive Summary and Policies and Procedure that we plan on posting on LegalOnline The most

not say that any of the revisions amount to substantive changes to the policy Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have regarding the enclosed however please also keep in mind that

only have 700 million in their warchest or if they can t make their Treasury payment they are toast What do these kinds of remarks mean to us legally Are we contracting with the surplus bloated

could be someone s full time job given the vast amount of confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how Enron handles different levels of confidential information including trade secrets Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel I would suggest that Pete Scott Tholan the IT security team internal corporate security as well as legal subject matter experts get together to put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material For example trading positions and curves would have one standard for access and disclosure while personnel information would have a different one The benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a periodic basis to make sure that they are followed rather than create updated inventories It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees I would not view this type of approach as requiring much if any assistance from outside counsel Let me know your
