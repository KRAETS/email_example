two coal plants in Conneticut UI s territory was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago The proposed purchase price of 350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a bargain price at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT Over the past 2 3 years the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they puked the plants to NRG for 350 kW in early 2000 At a minimum it is expected that 100 150 kW of SCR and or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies My strong view is that as a practical matter the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area In a true locational marginal price environment the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York Currently pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads regardless of who causes the congestion In the recently proposed single NE RTO model it is about 80 certain that the PJM locational marginal price market model will be implemented sometime between mid 2003 and mid 2004 At that point in time consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL in city Boston and CT will be exposed to higher energy prices while consumers in Maine New Hampshire and Rhode Island should see lower prices Given the facts above coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset node If we could buy these plants for approx 250 kW with 150 kW of environmental upgrades the resulting all in depr fixed variable O M fuel costs NOx SO2 capital reserve interest 7x24 plant cost would be approx 34 36 Mwh This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve Additional upside is derived from positive basis ICAP ancillary services emissions allowances and long term requirements sales to LSE s Lavo and Louise This could be the Alberta PPA for 2002 Lots of hair but lots of upside Any thoughts ","email_attachment":null,"recipient_count":"4"},{"sent_time":"2002-01-19 09:54:28-08:00","message_subject":"FW:  Meeting this

teaching in WA collecting WA retirement and has been teaching in Hermiston OR for the last 7 years Just to clarify Enron s international business model and North American business model are quite different I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US Enron NA s focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas power crude pulp paper metals etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs Enron s international business model on the other hand entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities This model is OK provided the business risk currency risk international risk change in law risk legal risk etc is priced properly by the debt and equity providers I will let you conclude which business model is better I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a free market model Later

We need to price the product properly and off peak needs just as much margin as on peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth Rather than shut down products increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market We are chipping away at our off peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal Am I making sense In addition I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas for both desks We will probably have to pay 3 50 4 00 spread to get 3 5 year 7x24 deal done With respect to NE the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off peak therefore in some ways the risk is easier to manage ","email_attachment":null,"recipient_count":"1"},{"sent_time":"2001-08-22 10:06:30-07:00","message_subject":"RE: Off PEak
