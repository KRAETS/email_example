week friday I would like to talk to you some more about the opportunities available in Enron Networks Two areas I thought would be interesting would either be helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to enter or help develop a market that Enron Networks is in the process of entering A couple of things that I thought were interesting about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most business plans where the strategy is build the site and the volume will come Enron uses it s own volume to entice other people to participate What most e commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating process but in reality this has very little value added unless the market is coupled with a finance clearinghouse function and a physical delivary system for physical goods We addressed some of these issues in the ilogex business plan I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e commerce I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning Thanks

Enron WR Hambrecht Co Enron Proprietary Trading Proposal III doc Dear Greg and John Following up on the call we had with John on March 19 the attached Executive Summary describes a joint venture between Enron WR Hambrecht a securities capability focused initially on proprietary trading of common stocks in the technology sector as the first phase of a relationship which could expand further to take advantage of financial market opportunities including equity derivatives trading and market making fixed income agency block and principal trading fixed income and hybrid securities derivatives and ECNs The financial model provided envisions supporting a relatively small initial effort to control enterprise risk as well as to provide a setting wherein Enron and WRH can begin to work together Economics should scale well in tandem with the amount of committed and reinvested capital In order for Enron to investigate this JV opportunity in depth we would like to propose as a next step a meeting at your offices wherein we may speak at some length to our ideas for collaboration In addition to this proposal as discussed we remain interested in exploring a separate effort focused on the area of lease securitization and would appreicate your guidance on how to proceed with initial conversations within Enron on this front Thanks for your consideration I look forward to speaking with

in our classroom and we can connect using two way video so that you can see the class members and they can see you I know that we can also arrange to put your power point slides on one screen and your face on another if we wish to At some point we ll get your technical people and our technical people to work out the details on the connection We would want to verify soon that our systems are compatible We can chat about how to use the 85 minutes we have I was thinking that we ask the students to prepare the digital case The Transformation of Enron 1986 2000 in which you appear in a few segments in living color and you look great I might add Liz said she thought she could a copy of the CD from Sherri Jeff Skilling s secretary or alternatively I ll be happy to send you a CD In addition to the case I would like to give the students additional new material accessible on the course web site about Enron s new ventures in the online and electronic network world We could use a little help from some of your people to get the best materials I suspect In class we could have a case discussion led by Venkat and I for say the first half of class and followed by your presentation talk for the last half of class Or we can give you more or less of the time let s talk about it I was hoping that you could direct the focus of your talk toward topics such as the following 1 The strategy for new ebusinesses at Enron 2 Enron s strategic advantages and competitive positioning in the digital economy 3 Examples of laws of network economics in the digital world 4 Implementation of Enron s digital strategy We need to prepare specific assignment questions for the students to prepare Some of them could be taken from the introduction to the case which we could supplement with additional questions from you or that we devise together This will be a great experience for our students and for Venkat and I as well And we are flexible about how much time you want to take and also about your specific topic So please give me a call or email and we can settle on a plan Thanks very much for your willingness to participate Samuel E Bodily John Tyler Professor of Business

well but met him a couple of times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL situation Anyway you had asked about other presenters and format The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for audience members to take away Following the formal presentations there will be questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all panel members Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel the moderator will be yours truly so I ll be serving up some softballs for Mike The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are Houstonstreet com Howard Smith Enemetrix com John Gaus Downstream com John Ireland We are expecting good attendance from industry both incumbants as well as new economy types as well as from the buyside So far there are over 100 participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations between now and the conference Logistically Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 we will work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley The panel will be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 probably around 9 am after which Mike will be free to attend other conference sessions play golf tour wineries or whatever The full list of sessions
