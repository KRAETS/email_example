promotion for the typical associate including timeline This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight I think radical change is not the answer The answer lies in a combination of a slight changes in process b increasing participation ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people and c a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives the closer to the front the better The goals of any restructuring are a eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu s perception that they lack ownership for the program b increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained c ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting selling and interviewing d ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the Enron technology which include skills in market understanding structuring finance logistics and risk e ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly ie quickly identify the Whalley Lavorato s in the program and on the flip side quickly deal with clear non performance issues f review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development retention and

time and effort into this important process There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people Effectively immediately written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered As per our discussion the PRC process is primarily a feedback performance management and staff planning tool It provides a data point for bonus purposes however it is not the only determinant In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool I would suggest that we implement the following a For employees ranked in the strong and above categories the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately b For employees ranked in the satisfactory needs improvement and issues category the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues For the satisfactory category the message should focus on increasing deal flow financial performance and productivity The bar is always being raised For the needs improvement category the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months For the issues category the business unit manager should determine in conjunction with your HR rep the appropriate plan to find a better fit in the organization or counsel out Regardless the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st I anticipate a similar

recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue ie we could increase the MW s at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months what value do we really get Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee 9

investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria however I do think this is a venture we should support In a nutshell it is providing 10MM in seed capital to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine generator sets These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology They are primarily utilized for back up power emergency power VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile flexible low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change The benefits include a 50 plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO similar companies in this space include Active Power Capstone and Elektryon b origination opportunities the ENA mid stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities 2001 to 2002 time frame to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications c learning the distributed generation renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand If ENA through this venture can make this technology work it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk d low risk it is expected that roughly 50 of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize e low tech this solution utilizes existing turbine SCR technology and f ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture However this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a it is a very early stage company and b ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out Given that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture it is worth the initial work Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton Florida We have a very solid history with this company They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B s which are currently operating at New Albany They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50 ENA would ultimately have a buy out clause at a fixed number for their 50 If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting Regards

the US assets probably the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites I m not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired assets I would speak to Sherriff on that one However I would caution that real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on Enron s development electricity coal and emissions talents For ComEd and Homer City Mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin Now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile however I think it may be difficult to arb these guys As well I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them I m not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a Wall Street point of view We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia assets Are they in QF if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran s point of view Dave given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve coal assets or coal QF s may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset expansion brownfield point of view Have we looked at this Are

a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices Our current goal is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant E P concern that desires an offshore division The concentration operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a very poor IPO candidate ie I m not sure that an IPO was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points a Mariner is not on the
