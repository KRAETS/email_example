also because demand has been so slow A number of sources say NBSK i s at 480 tonne for October though a few are paying the 500 tonne price I don t think we will pay 500 in November a buyer said today I thin k it will be 490 An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as a pl us but added Now all we need is for demand to pick up Another agent a lso responded cautiously There is no indication

restructure its units in a cost cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais 22 million per year Klabin one of Brazil s top producers of paper tissue and wood pulp will incorporate its Klamasa KIV Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA the company said in a statement Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par Klabin s Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters The restructuring to be completed by December should reduce administrative operational financial and tax costs It will also improve operating synergies allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group s transparency for investors Klabin said We have a lot of business between the group That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies Verillo said The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais 22 million per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001 driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil s currency The company posted net revenues of 1 9 billion reais 684 million in 2000 ","received_time":"2001-10-15

also chopped in little pieces Tomato Sauce Red Pepper Black Pepper Bay Leaf Lemon Juice Salt White wine Vegetable Oil The process 1 Clean and wash the fish Cut the head off you don t need that Place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it Leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce 2 In another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions After about 4 min add a little black pepper red pepper garlic salt and bay leaf and stir 3 Continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color Then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring You will have a reddish sauce ready 4 In a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish Place the fish in the middle Then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven Keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast When you serve it ad lemon juice again Another way of cooking the trout fish much easier and I think tastier Get a small trout this time After cleaning it place it in a baking pan Then add olive oil into it lots of it lemon juice chopped tomatoes about 2 tomatoes and olives Just bake it and there you have it Again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice It s delicious Try any of these and let me know how they taste Have fun Monika","received_time":"2001-10-02
