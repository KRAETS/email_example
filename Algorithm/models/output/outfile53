found the one she wanted in Oaks of Devonshire It s over at Louetta and I 45 just before The Thicket It s a little bigger than we were looking for 3100 sq ft but it s got a great game room sunroom for the kids It was built in 86 so it needs a little work But that s ok with me Anyway we are closing on both houses on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday We will have you and Linda over for lunch or dinner one of these days We also had tubes put into Jake s ears this month We hated having to do that but it has really made a difference He had a constant ear infection since October Now you can tell that he feels so much better He s learning more and more each day We have nothing that is Jake proof Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets don t hold him He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over that it will eventually slip or break and then your in I m going to install pad locks on the cabinets at the new house We ll see if that stops him Anyway everybody s doing well

I was out last week The rate 04 mmbtu will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant The fee will be adjusted yearly based on CPI Bob I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes actuals or nominations I think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis We would receive the estimates actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance even though the plant kept the noms at the 45 000 base I also think that if the plant does increase the nom they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less Do you agree with this D From Sandi M Braband on 10 10 2000 03 41 PM To Daren J
