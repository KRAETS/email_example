McKinsey Company is conducting a large study of global corporations their management practices and organization Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company s operations I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential and will be used solely by the Stanford McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others

this new and exciting event Make your reservations today See meeting details below Harvard University Club of Houston Harvard Forum Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence Dinner and Discussion Club Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience Ever wanted to talk substantively about a topic while having a great dinner but were afraid that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in the conversation We have the solution Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years the Harvard Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow club members The format works like this we ll have dinner and then a panel of Harvard grads will give brief introductions to the evening s topic from their perspective and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves first in a large group and then in small groups The panel members will be knowledgeable but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated They will however be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than ever maybe better than you ever wanted The topic we ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled Our children may be growing up in a world far more affluent privileged than we enjoyed How imperiled is their character by our success What practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the character values that we treasure We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every

time now I have wanted to take some time off and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid unvested sabbatical Primarily for reasons of precedence he was unwilling to pursue this option which while it is disappointing to me I accept The purpose of this note is twofold First I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly Second I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non compete provisions with regard to future payouts I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor At present I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying and travelling with my family I have nothing planned professionally as of yet but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively I hope that s not too presumptuous Please let me know your thoughts on this non compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward Again Jeff thanks for many great memories and as an Enron shareholder keep up the great work Jay ","received_time":"2001-05-09
