Associated Press 3 18 2001 MONTGOMERY Ala AP When Auburn s football fortunes took a turn for the worse in 1998 trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not be retained after the season former university President William Muse said When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall he said he was essentially fired Basically Mr Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season and coach Bowden basically in my opinion panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract Muse said More Auburn football Talkin Tigers Forum Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden whose team was off to a 1 5 start Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did not speak directly to him but went through athletic director David Housel That s how David and I worked Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his Orlando home We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted me to do I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn t be enough to save his job Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15 A transcript of the meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until the wee hours of the morning then told him that Lowder didn t have the authority to fire him and urged him to stay until the end of the season Muse said that was the most celebrated case of Lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions but there are many others Bowden often commented that Mr Lowder hired me and that the coach had regular contact with the powerful trustee Muse said Bowden said he spoke with Lowder weekly if not daily during his first two or three seasons but never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I should do it Muse said Lowder did not hand pick the coach He said an eight member search committee including Lowder voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 1993 Let s just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me hired said Bowden now a television commentator with ABC There s no doubt about it Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden s contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed They also denied that Lowder was pulling the strings on that decision Bowden always believed that the only way he got that job was because of Lowder s influence Muse said So he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator Wayne Hall Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder s relationship is with Bowden s successor Tommy Tuberville but that he believes basketball coach Cliff Ellis has very very frequent contact with the Montgomery banker Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide support and input to the president and athletic director and that it s time to focus on positive accomplishments and stop bickering
