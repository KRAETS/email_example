on my review conducted the morning of February 6th here is a list of items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk s Flow Summary sheet PGT These numbers appear to be one day off The numbers in the Test Sheet for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for February 5th I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT s website for the 5th Generally we use the Cycle 2 numbers however sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting Northwest None of these numbers match our flow sheet It appears the Test Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations whereas we use Cycle 6 However the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 7 am we are not sure why I understand you may pull the numbers from a different place so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier TW TW numbers appear to be correct except for the IB Link number We pull the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I C point reported by TW It looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point They differ by about 5 000 but I don t know if one is more correct than the other To be consistent though we should probably change the Test Sheet PGE The numbers also appear to be one day off The numbers for February 6th are identical to our Feb 5th numbers Is this a reporting or a scrubbing problem It is possible you are pulling the data from the website before they update it with the next day s data We manually type these numbers in If you pull from our spreadsheet then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run El Paso Most of the numbers appear to be correct except for the plant receipts The numbers are close but we should compare our formulas because I don t think this is a cycle problem General The Difference column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle for the current with the final cycle of the previous day This can cause intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day fluxuations Any Difference column should compare identical cycles I suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day and the previous day This way we can compare identical cycles as well as pick up any intraday fluxuations As we discussed you ll let me know when you re ready to revise this report These notes should give us a great place to start I look forward to getting this report ready to use

to use pivot tables it s pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts well i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another media i e speaking to you but i guess you need to know asap so i ll attempt it through email even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts b c there s always misunderstandings i guess the reason i m very hesitant about you coming is b c i don t know what you expect from the visit we both know things are obviously different b w us more recently than they had been when you initially moved i m not sure about the reasons you feel different about me but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about you first we don t really see each other often and that obviously makes someone feel less for a person regardless of who it is you have agreed with this second since i started my job and have other things going on in my life i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don t like being emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen so i ve tried to get rid of all my feelings for you also i don t like limiting myself as if something will happen i don t know about you but regardless of how much we said we weren t anything and we were free to do what we want there was still a limit on what we could do with us visiting each other in more than a friendly way i felt somewhat limited by limited i mean i always felt i could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each other as more than just friends don t worry there isn t anyone else it s just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don t like especially when i ve realized it s hopeless to expect anything with us so i guess the reason i m nervous about your visit is b c i think you would want it to be like our other visits i e you stay over my place in my bed and we hang out together all weekend where i don t think i want that i would like if you visited but not how we usually visit those are my thoughts although not clearly explained b c of hte email thing let me know what you think

table contains a WSCCRegion field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a Fuel Designation field Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of CapacityOut for all outage records where the date falls between the BeginOutageDate and the EndOutageDate I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data Objective The objective is to return the Sum of CapacityOut by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range say 1 1 2000 to 1 1 2001 There are roughly five possible parameters for Fuel Designation seven for WSCCRegion and two for OutageReason The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range Format Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way Alternatively we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided If the second option is used we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65 000 rows In this case we would use the OutageReason grouping which only has two parameters to split out the two lists Thanks for your help Mat

conversation the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track compute report etc Background The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines however each day the injections and withdrawals are available In the past our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day s balance As we get validation of the balances through phone calls and or postings we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation Currently our reporting storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports Task Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table It is our intent to have a DRN established and some already have been created that would hold the storage balance each day However this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity Lastly these storage balances could be manual entry points but would require manual calculation each day representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature Timeline This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets At a minimum we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week

a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market Then that day s transactions can be entered to calculate the P L of transactions which close out previous positions as well as to calculate the new open positions Initially I thought that daily P L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P L whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid offer of the closed out position by the offer bid of the new position of course time value and storage costs would be included However this only works if the person is 100 hedged meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100 hedging I should be able to do this except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there The main question I have is simply Should I be calculating the P L for each person s storage book for open and closed positions Then beyond that if we do calculate the P L s from the buyer side it seems that if their storage is not hedged I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it So I guess I could apply the model for that purpose Does this make sense to you Any comments are appreciated

table I don t really have a query that prepares the data for the summary table the other two queries in the Access database are a start The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the report to look like It might be good to group the first table by region and then fuel type as well When you have a chance to look this stuff over I d be happy to discuss it further Thanks Mat

hope things are still going well I ve been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe I m scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically

learning the ropes As they hire the needed full time schedulers and I get up to speed I ll move into market research for the traders My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection withdrawel strategies Let s just say my plate looks to be full By the way I m sure you saw the previous email from our buddy Ted Bland Looks like he got

users to query facility and review data related to an order For instance if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities This would not be possible or at least not achieved as easily without the many to many relationship So yes you are giving up functionality so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database As far as actually modifying the database there would be some manual labor required
