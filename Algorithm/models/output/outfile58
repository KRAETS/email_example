Trading Legal Database David Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted into our Financial Trading Database This databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed London currently updates this database to manage its and Singapore s financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system This database serves a number of purposes First it is our core memory of contract negotiations Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts For instance it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front In addition with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database Further we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing reporting and insurance inquiries For online trading I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our Clients whether traders or back office support people Employees outside legal have limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential Legal and Credit comments They have no edit capabilities The database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have found helpful You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you It usually takes a few days Once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database and we can figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October That would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you

federal election on November 27th We will not have any such problems however not because we are any better than anyone in fact I am not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand or have ever have understood the ballot or voted for who they thought they were voting for but rather because of the political system which Jon s ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us which I refer to as parliamentary dictatorship Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat but that is the independent middle of the road yeah right view of a Canadian observer Jon I cannot however apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought upon us other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system into 11 separate parliamentary systems and I suppose that could be construed as an apology of sorts except for the record I will never apologize to you for anything until you make

that Anthony Campos has received to date on this contract Based on this information and from previous requests from Legal for Global Contracts to refer any interpretations to Legal the Global

far the only physical trading area where a governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained to trade power For financial trading we do have to inquire into the relevant governmental entities authority to enter into derivative transactions In order to do that we look at statutory authority any relevant local regulations investment policities etc in addition to obtaining legal opinions on the subject and with some counterparties hiring outside counsel to advise us For most governmental entities if we do not have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence I will not be approving them to trade financial products As far as the financial test for the US based counterparty list I check with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US eligible swap participant standards As I m sure you know for most plain vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of 10mm or a net worth of 1mm Pretty much if I am turning down a counterparty to trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are a governmental or quasi governmental entity If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet a 6mm asset test to trade any products then I will add this to my daily

updates this database to manage its and Singapore s financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system This database serves a number of purposes First it is our core memory of contract negotiations Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts For instance it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front In addition with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database Further we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing reporting and insurance inquiries For online trading I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our Clients whether traders or back office support people Employees outside legal have limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential Legal and Credit comments They have no edit capabilities The database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have found helpful You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you It usually takes a few days Once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database and we can figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October That would be a good time for me to

batting coach We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls but actually swung at curve balls It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter league play earlier in the year The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit said the Mets batting coach The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game While some of the strikes called against the Mets were in fact balls there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series the commissioner said Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that based on on base percentage the Mets had actually won the World Series regardless of the final scores of the games It s clear that we were slightly on base more often than the Yankees said a Mets spokesman The

for London based customers A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around the world We don t want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice Our office is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia while London leads the efforts in Europe After we each receive advice we provide copies and communicate to each other the advice received Even though we both receive the same legal advice sometimes we don t always agree on the approach in a particular country and at the end of the day each Legal Dept is responsible for their own clients As far as the advice on Mexico Chile and Argentina as I told Justin the advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can transact financial products in these countries we have certain legal risks in doing so and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these and further most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of process here in the U S which we require in order to trade with us Since what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products we don t waste our time doing the due diligence at this point If a counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time resolving those

guests to the bathroom It is not necessary to do anything Just sit and stare DOORS Do not allow any closed doors in any room To get door open stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws Once door is opened it is not necessary to use it After you have ordered an outside door opened stand halfway in and out and think about several things This is particularly important during very cold weather rain snow or mosquito season CHAIRS AND RUGS If you have to throw up get to a chair quickly If you cannot manage in time get to an Oriental rug If there is no Oriental rug shag is good When throwing up on the carpet make sure you back up so it is as long as a humans bare foot HAMPERING If one of your humans is engaged in some activity and the other is idle stay with the busy one This is called helping otherwise known as hampering Following are the rules for hampering 1 When supervising cooking sit just behind the left heel of the cook You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on and then picked up and comforted 2 For book readers get in close under the chin between eyes and book unless you can lie across the book itself 3 For paperwork lie on the work in the most appropriate manner so as to obscure as much of the work as possible Pretend to doze but every so often reach out and slap the pencil or pen 4 For people paying bills or working on income taxes or Christmas cards keep in mind the aim to hamper First sit on the paper being worked on When dislodged watch sadly from the side of the table When activity proceeds nicely roll around on the papers scattering them to the best of your ability After being removed for the second time push pens pencils and erasers off the table one at a time 5 When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him her be sure to jump on the back of the paper Humans love to jump 6 When human is working at computer jump up on desk walk across keyboard bat at mouse pointer on screen and then lay in human s lap across arms hampering typing in progress WALKING As often as possible dart quickly and as close as possible in front of the human especially on stairs when they have something in their arms in the dark and when they first get up in the morning This will help their coordination skills BEDTIME Always sleep on the human at night so he she cannot move around LITTER BOX When using the litter box be sure to kick as much litter out of the box as possible Humans love the feel of kitty litter between their toes HIDING Every now and then hide in a place where the humans cannot find you Do not come out for three to four hours under any circumstances This will cause the humans to panic which they love thinking that you have run away or are lost Once you do come out the humans will cover you with love and kisses and you will probably get a treat ONE LAST THOUGHT Whenever possible get close to a human especially their face turn around and present your butt to them Humans love this so do it

preparing confirmations This database is available to all Enron employees so feel free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it helpful There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of legal client confidentiality concerns Any member of your legal team should be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active close negotiation on a master or if a master is being amended what the amendments might address sometimes helpful when Houston isn t at work yet Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a specific finance project or product unusual but sometimes Also as I mentioned not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi Currency Masters so look to confirm what type of master we entered into If they are not ISDA Multi Currency Masters it may not be possible to put a cross border trade under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation Please note there is a listing for Restrictions which will reflect any trading limitations such as crude oil trades only no trades over 2 years contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading limitations Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain critical trading guidance Another note to watch out for is that many US based master may have Texas law instead of NY Certainly not UK law We hope to have that information available in the database in the future If for some reason you can t access this database let me know and we ll get our respective computer people to figure out why As I mentioned I am a paralegal in the Houston swap

mail with me within the last 2 3 months please reply because my address has changed Thanks Zoltan The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race realized that if they continued in the usual manner they were going to blow up the whole world One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight They would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and which ever side s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world The losing side would have to lay down its arms The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler females in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter killed his siblings and gave him all the milk They used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it When the day came for the dog fight the Americans showed up with a strange animal It was a nine foot long Dachshund Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog When the cages were opened up the Dachshund came out of it s cage and slowly waddled over towards the Russian dog The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of it s cage and charged the American dachshund But when it got close enough to bite the Dachshund s neck the Dachshund opened it s mouth and consumed the Russian dog in one bite There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief We don t understand how this could have happened We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler females in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves That s nothing an American replied We had our best plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved to trade I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the European products including specifically European physical power products which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade especially physical power What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties is that with respect to Non Us Canadian products as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power which I never open them for Also Credit Derivatives I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it So my question to you is did London actively approve the non US Canadian based products especially physical power If you didn t then I am going to take this as an oversight of the pre

EnronOnline Transactions Hi Tana We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows On Friday April 20 2001 four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that were in error One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L P and three transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc As mutually agreed to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties it was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and should be terminated The exact specifics are detailed as follows The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member Melba Lozano Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline test system of EnronOnline The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis However in his absence on Friday the product was managed by Matt Lenhart Steve South trader on the West Desk called and notified both Morgan and Coral that the product had been posted in error All parties agreed that the transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing As a result they further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that the deals would be killed on all sides For reference of any telephone tapes that may need to be pulled the conversations with the counterparties occurred around 2 00 pm No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the transactions in TAGG I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday April 23 2001 and advised him that termination letters may be required by Legal He responded that he had no problem with that Tana please advise if additional information is required to complete the termination

needs to be designed I ve been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process Then once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees I ve developed two new databases we re currently working the kinks out of First is our jurisdictional database which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going I ve actually got the database designed we re working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon Of course the compelling project for us over the last 6 9 months has been online trading I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved and tie each product to a contract We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda legal advice etc This will be a cross product library financial physical power etc I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them So I ve got to create a lawyer user friendly index Among other documents this is I think where our forms might reside in addition all the research and advice on various legal issues we ve received from outside counsel as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world So the setup for this might go quickly although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem The last part we ve got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system Maybe when you have time we can have a

Dave Forster by Monday to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non Australian based counterparty a counterparty could be U S Canadian European or other country based who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place and may or may not have credit in place to do a financial power transaction with Enron Australia In that regard I am attaching as a template our form of online Deemed ISDA GTC for a weather transaction the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation As you can see when you look at our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes such as authority and tax representations arm s length transaction reps acting as a principal rep the deletion of section 2 c ii of the ISDA Schedule netting in respect of the same transaction no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it your deletion of language re written confirmations definition of Transaction meaning the GTC ISDA form website terms Website uppercased is a defined term under the Password Application we usually say Loss instead of Market Quotation also Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6 e a question do we need the word integrated with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a single agreement to fall under the U S bankruptcy swap protection no ducment conflict provisions missing our severability and setoff language no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions business day defined as Sydney only etc Of course you do not have these in your form of GTC because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow After all the above I just have to say we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues

It was signed by Chris McKey formerly head of Enron Frankfurt office and presumably by VWD We are simply going to be using the existing agreement which does not mention EnronOnline whatsoever since it generically allows us to use their news on ANY single Enron website we choose does not restrict us As such is it necessary to have the copy signed by VWD I would have thought that the important signature was the Enron signature since we are paying them for a service not vice versa All other agreements related to EnronOnline this side of the Atlantic are pending non executed to the best of my knowledge Michael do you know of any other signed agreements that specifically relate to EnronOnline in Germany The only other one that has possibly been signed is an agreement with a company called IMP that Nick Mooney arranged for some sort of outsourced direct marketing work for EnronOnline suspect this is very small potatoes but will find out However I d suggest you contact Kal Shah he may

go in and change the profile for this counterparty I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade especially physical power What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties is that with respect to Non Us Canadian products as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power which I never open them for Also Credit Derivatives I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it So my question to you is did London actively approve the non US Canadian
