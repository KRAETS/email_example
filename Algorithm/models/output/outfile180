week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas As you know Enron Dutapar Copel and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas Copel has as interest along with El Paso in the power plant which would use the gas A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow The gas supply contract would have a 20 year term and would be worth 1 2 billion The ground for the suit would be that under Brazilian law Compagas is required to solicit bids for the gas supply arrangement Compagas has sought to justify not soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of supplying the gas This is incorrect Enron among others is also capable of supplying the gas We have a legal opinion supporting our position and have called for a special shareholders meeting to discuss the issue We anticipate that Petrobras and Copel despite their obvious conflict of interest will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement nonetheless Tozzini Freire has been advising us and is doing an excellent job If you approve we would like to continue to use them if

repressed the actual date I journeyed to Fort Worth Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting one being held I think in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar The Law Review had reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels I arrived late at night dutifully registered at the hotel s desk received my room key took the elevator to the designated floor walked to my room inserted the room key and opened the door The darkness that shrouded the room was suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man almost naked leaping out of the bed toward me shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his room It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was adamantly insisting on an explanation he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offer him one Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when I see one I exited the scene of the controversy with as much speed as my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury There may well have been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police but in the end I settled for a new room the door of which I bolted immediately After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent reappearance of the madman I arose showered dressed and carefully made my way to the meeting room During the course of the day I spotted the madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends I asked if he knew him The answer was no but he did know who he was The name is Susman my man Steve Susman I immediately resolved that my path and that of Susman my man Steve Susman would never again cross Truth is indeed stranger than fiction How could I have possibly foreseen as I fled from the madman in that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as his lawyer that he would serve as mine and that I would count him as one of my closest friends I hereby officially forgive you Steve not only for stealing my Fort Worth hotel room but also for the injury you wished on me that night Looking back on it I wouldn t want it to have been any other way I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays Steve Thanks for your friendship I treasure it All the best Jim
