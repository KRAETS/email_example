Enron ENRON cc Subject Microsoft Lawsuit You ve probably seen this already but just in case also their performance review process sounds a lot like ours No 200 Monday October 16 2000 Page A 3 ISSN 1522 5968 News Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee Alleges Discrimination Based on Race Sex SEATTLE A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities Donaldson v Microsoft Corp W D Wash No C00 1684P 10 4 00 Such discrimination at the company is the standard operating procedure the lawsuit said The suit filed Oct 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay other job benefits and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 400 African American employees and some 4 500 female employees Mark Murray company spokesman said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind We take these kinds of issues very seriously Murray said regarding the lawsuit The company has an active diversity policy and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women Murray told BNA Oct 12 He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb 23 1999 and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct 4 1998 Microsoft employs some 18 000 workers in the U S the complaint said About 2 5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women Murray said the company has about 27 250 employees in the U S including 21 767 in Western Washington In the U S 26 3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 22 2 percent minorities he said The lawsuit was filed by Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll of Seattle The named plaintiff Monique Donaldson sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment at the company the complaint said The violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and Civil Rights Act of 1871 are systemic in nature and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft s operations the lawsuit maintains Excessive Subjectivity Alleged The complaint said the company allows excessive subjectivity in decisions involving promotions and compensation Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained either internally or externally about Microsoft s treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them The lawsuit said the company uses an excessively subjective evaluation system that allows managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit Performance evaluations for instance use a five point scale but scores of five the highest number are not awarded Within any organization of the company only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score which can range from 2 5 to 4 5 the lawsuit said Thus no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores Any employee with a 2 5 score is placed on a personal improvement plan or asked to resign the complaint said Stack rankings are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst the complaint said Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations the lawsuit said Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees personal popularity with other managers because the rankings mix employees working for different managers In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries substantially lower than those paid white males doing similar work with the same or lesser skills and with similar or lesser experience the lawsuit said Furthermore excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria are applied in promotions which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees By Nan Netherton Copyright 2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs Inc Washington D C "},{"received_time":"2000-11-03

observation about the call While I don t know anything about the transaction the conversation about employment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previously submitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enron required in completing its due diligence review and used that written schedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received Enron should not let the other side s data schedule or lack of a complete schedule control Enron s due diligence agenda Enron should know in advance what information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the due diligence process That way the other side will better understand what Enron expectations are I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is very helpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side how long they have had it and what items are still missing I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday It was though people were

LON ECT ECT Subject EU US Safe Harbor agreement Jane I participated in a lunch yesterday on Capitol Hill which discussed the recently concluded bilateral negotiations between Europe and the US on the issue of data privacy safe harbor I admit that I don t fully understand the issue but in essence I m told it s an internal EU directive passed a few years ago not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet by the way that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of the privacy of transmitted data eg over the internet The EU wants to forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don t adequately protect the information As always the EU wants to regulate the issue while the US prefers self regulation After two years of negotations they agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be put in safe harbors which are basically approved bodies that would check the recipient s ability to protect the privacy of the information ie an American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or offices How does this affect Enron A couple of other company reps said it is especially pertinent to HR issues such as transmitting personnel information salary etc from Europe back to the home office in the US Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe does this affect us and do you want us to track down more information Regards Steve Burns "},{"received_time":"2000-12-07

Walker I believe Walker s confusion was created by Diane Neilsen Before he called Walker Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party The fax simply said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show but never said that Enron didn t want him at the party I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place Tow who had just walked into the office when I called said that he was working on it that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it which he apparently had not read and that he had to let me go because he had clients on the line On another note I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste Sullivan to Mike Rosen which attaches an unexecuted

wanted to be included but somehow as I was trying to get away for vacation I failed to remember to tell Twanda who was setting up the meeting I apologize for the oversight it was not intentional I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings I am sorry about this one Basically the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC is it a compensation system or a feedback system Because the process tries to address both there is a tension between the organization s interests comp promotion etc and that of the employee feedback development etc This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system This tension has given people lots of heartburn To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn t create too much change Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating For example a strong performer really could be excellent but compared to others in the group ended up in the third category For this reason the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic Also there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old HR language For example a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like Always raises the bar franchise player etc rather than a HR definition relating to demonstrating criteria Also people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn t much difference between the two There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive Also there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a black box and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process This was only the first meeting I will make sure that you are invited to attend any subsequent ones and I apologize for the first one Let me know if you

Michelle Please let know what you thing regarding the following 1 Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and whether or not they are due money for the coverage One could argue and they obviously are that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to everyone I m sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis 2 Russell Gilardi s attorney has made comment that one could interpret his contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the year Here is the wording verbatim Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter both you and the Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to terminate your employment such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st January 2001 I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the separation agreements For your info other RW employees with this particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out 3 Joel Insinga is requesting that his non compete be reduced from 6 months to 3 months He was with MG for a little over a month I ve asked the SVP of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end Cathy

Callahan enron com Subject Re Celgar Asbestos Claims Michelle Sorry I should have been more clear on the 4 6 vacation pay That is the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act It applies to non union employees It only applies to union employees if the equivalent provisions in the collective agreement do not meet or exceed the Act s provisions Since the collective agreement s provisions are better than the provisions in the Act the Act s vacation pay provisions do not apply to union employees In terms of the payment schedule for union employees the collective agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of the year I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non union employees but I ll check on that When their actual time for vacation comes up they may actually have to take that time off without any pay if they ve already elected to take the pay earlier For both union and non union employees vacation pay is earned and accrued in one year and paid out the next So in 2001 all Celgar employees will be entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000 earnings With respect to the standard employment contract there really isn t one save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all employees The letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample It was in the package I sent on Friday last week If you don t have it please let me know and I ll send it There are also position descriptions for every union and non union employees that are given to the employees upon hiring These might also be considered part of the contract of

forwarded to me Peter s questions regarding the risk of asbestos litigation at Celgar Under the Workers Compensation Act employers in British Columbia are required to contribute to an accident fund which provides compensation for injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment In turn the Act provides employers statutory immunity from damages in respect of any personal injury disablement or death arising out of and in the course of employment The accident fund would cover asbestos claims There are no exceptions which would allow asbestos litigation against employers The Act does not prohibit litigation against third parties eg manufacturers of asbestos but employers as stated are immune from such actions Compensation is payable if the worker sustains pulmonary injury

tried to salt jobs down there in Florida The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre hire agreement if possible The business managers will take notes keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur Should we designate one person to handle union relations We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons That way we don t have the unions approaching our employees We have no obligation to have such conversations but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them Better to be polite let them know that we are mobilizing the project but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre hire agreement We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring but that we are not taking applications at this time We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site which will be at an off site Human Resources office We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates There is a need for HR to look at the off site office before the lease is signed Other issues surround gating at the facility How will it be gated Who will control entry and exits What about the other ways into the site How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people Parking area will be on the other side of the plant There are roads between the parking gate and the building site Because of all these issues we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation Back to Mark s suggestions Be careful of calls coming into the project Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead Also should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans E g Are you hiring electricians out there Those should be referred to HR s off site office Also those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries Be sure to follow the 30 day rule Also follow our hiring practices consistently Ultimately there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site perhaps the last week of October on union avoidance and other issues One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions Galen Millie is going to send those to David Lund David

employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25 of the performance criteria under Enron s annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question Employee s annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively shall be based on an annual bonus target of This language does not address a person s performance as compared to one s peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25 of those criteria Thus if there are only 3 rating categories i e 1 2 3 distributed as 10 80 10 then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25 33 of the rating criteria Given the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25 of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted As a result I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories i e 2A 2B or 2C That way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus If there is a decision not to break down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high For those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10 80 10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75 of the categories under that process Of course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc in this process Please let me know if you have any questions "},{"received_time":"2000-11-26

a top hat plan and need to resolve that issue But most importantly we cannot draft a deferral provision for purchasing stock options or phantom stock appreciation rights until we know the details of

of them look fine with me I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace citizenship personal travel and reason for return from prior assignment The questions about birthplace citizenship are the most risky As I have discussed with others such questions could create issues of national origin discrimination particularly if one s birthplace country is not evident from any other source It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking questions that are not job related and consistent with business necessity What is the purpose of this inquiry Are we trying to determine whether a person is eligible to work in a particular country If so it appears that birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need We already have a field on where a person is eligible to work which would cover the situation where a person has citizenship in one country but is on a work visa to another Any other information may not be necessary The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth information that we really don t want to keep on a system For example if a person left because of health reasons or the birth of a child it really is not a job related issue What is the purpose of this question Is there a less intrusive way to ask it Finally the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job related What is the purpose of that inquiry Is there another way to gather that information Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above If you would

Workers Prove Job Bias By RICHARD CARELLI c The Associated Press WASHINGTON June 12 Workers who say their employers illegally discriminated against them can win lawsuits or at least get their accusations to a jury without direct evidence of intentional bias the Supreme Court ruled Monday The court s unanimous decision in an age bias dispute from Mississippi could carry profound practical importance as well for lawsuits nationwide that charge employment discrimination based on race sex and physical disabilities The ruling was a huge setback for employers because some federal appeals courts routinely had dismissed lawsuits that lacked smoking gun evidence of employers discriminatory intent Monday s decision said circumstantial evidence often is enough to sue employers successfully Employer organizations were disappointed The bottom line is it may be tougher to get cases out of the hands of the jury said Peter Petsch a lawyer for the Society for Human Resource Management In some jurisdictions we re going to see more litigation which lasts longer even for employers who did nothing wrong he said But Thomas Osborne an AARP lawyer praised the decision as a victory for the some 12 million over 50 workers who belong to his organization because it says employers no longer can lie about their personnel decisions and get away with it The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers Osborne said In a series of employment bias decisions the nation s highest court has imposed various requirements on employees who say they were treated illegally They must show they were subjected to adverse treatment and that the employer s asserted reason for such treatment was phony But federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point whether employees who discredit an employer s stated reason must also offer proof of a discriminatory motive Not always the Supreme Court said Monday Justice Sandra Day O Connor wrote that a federal appeals court wrongly relied on the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional independent evidence of discrimination Proof that the defendant s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination and it may be quite persuasive she said In appropriate circumstances the trier of fact can reasonably infer form the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose O Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a job bias lawsuit after showing that an employer s explanation for their treatment was false But she ruled that it was enough in the case of a Mississippi man who said age discrimination cost him his supervisory job at a toilet seat manufacturing plant Roger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus Miss after he was fired in 1995 from his job as a hinge department supervisor in the plant Reeves then 57 had worked at the plant for 40 years His lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act and a jury awarded him 70 000 in damages and 28 490 in lost pay But the 5th U S Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award after ruling that Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age bias Reeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore protected by the federal law that he had been fired and replaced with someone younger Such evidence amounted to what courts call a prima facie showing of discrimination Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the firing Once it did the burden shifted back to Reeves to show that the stated reason was false He also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a supervisor Company officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time records but he showed that he had not The jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias but the appeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the company s decision was motivated by age bias Monday s decision said the appeals court was wrong about that and reinstated the jury s verdict AP NY 06 12 00 1522EDT Copyright 2000 The Associated Press The

Chapman today and basically Jon deferred to you since the RW employees in NY are a question for US employment law Melissa and I do believe that the RW US based employees that were given UK style employment letters such as the sample one I gave you are our employees because of those letters they were given offer letters by MG before the MG Enron deal went unconditional and in most cases they accepted them so they were MG employees when all MG employees became our employees If it is a fact that they are Enron employees we have to figure out the liability associated with terminating them It appears that on Monday MG and Enron leadership will decide to exit some of the London and New York RW business that MG acquired and some minimum 9 max 15 of the former RW employees will need to be terminated during August John Sheriff and Gary Hickerson both want to know the cost of that decision Right now we are assuming that we are liable for the severance periods stated in the offer letters to the people we would like to be able to avoid that cost estimated at 700k and 1 5M depending on who is redundant or reduce it if possible However if it is your recommendation that we have to honor those letters so be it If you have any questions please call Melissa Laing tie line 8303 6617 in the UK and she can find me Thanks Hoyt Michelle Cash ECT 07 28 2000 10 10 AM To Hoyt Thomas NA Enron

certain key personnel from RW The remaining RW employees do not automatically come with the assets I am working on obtaining more information on the RW side of things from lawyers here in the US Key to employment decisions will be provisions of the asset purchase agreement if any are applicable You might check with Jon Chapman in the UK to see whether he has any more information on this point

that you do I will bring copies of all the offer letters MG wrote to RW employees I think there are something like 27 or 28 They are all very similar to the one or two that I have already given you I believe that we will not want to keep some of the businesses that are being acquired with Rudolph Wolff particularly the FX business in New York Naturally some of the people in the potentially discontinued business received the onerous letters Gary Hickerson has to decide what he is going to do with this by August 18 if not sooner With the letters that were delivered I would like to get an opinion from you on what we have to do to terminate the people associated with the business assuming that Gary wants to shut it down Also MG have 4 to 6 employees in Montreal We HR are trying to convince the business side that we do not want any people in Montreal because of the employment laws but it does not appear that we will succeed We may reduce the size of the office though and we may not want to put them on the Canadian payroll particularly is we only keep 1 2 people there Do you have contacts in Montreal that can advise us on how to terminate any employees that we choose to terminate What would be the Enron position on having them on a separate payroll from Enron Canada Thanks Hoyt "},{"received_time":"2000-11-26

entitled Acquiring Information Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act EEA Daniel Waltz of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment Congress passed the EEA in 1996 and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects uses and protects valued information In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA Dan Waltz will include hypothetical corporate case studies some actually torn from the headlines to illustrate his points This event is sponsored by ENA s Competitive Analysis and Business Controls CABC group and is supported by ENA legal This event kicks off CABC s Competitive Intelligence Standards Program which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron s practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA s legal guidelines as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron s own proprietary information I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age The EEA presentation is set for August 15 1 30 3 00 PM in the 50th floor Conference room Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon

was sent on 5 4 to Keith Dziadek for an opening he had We got no response from Keith which for him is considered a no We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS He was directly recruited by Ergos presented by them and hired through them Jennifer talked with Mark and he states that he has never talked to a recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions If CS did indeed present his resume to Enron then they should be able to produce the email with date time stamp Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet I feel Robert and I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation Robert had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week and I think we should make good on the promise Here are my recommendations please give me your thoughts 1 I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone 2 Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John Nguyen based on above facts 3 Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list and CS is not on it since no one is interested in working with them We should let them know that yes they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract placement but this does not require us to accept resumes from them We accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with recruiting We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days give them a second chance and have the guidelines for the trial period well defined They should contact me directly at that time 4 We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn the difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been made and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in order to press the point They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer s decision not to employ them as a vendor 1 inadequate resume flow 2 poor working relationship with account manager 5 We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other company including Continential Shell Services and Dynegy and after addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred Nor did she did send Mark Delaro s resume to Ergos We have no reason to believe that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron nor that she will in the future 6 Cheryl Charles Maddison presented her resume to Robert and Ryan and Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2

personnel we want to employ but that there are many whom we don t want to hire I am not really familiar with the specific facts here The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own by setting compensation controlling their activities engaging in promotion discipline termination etc decisions and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees So if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing with one as a contractor and one as an employee there could be some issues particularly if they share a supervisor Unfortunately that often is the case with contract personnel If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers and like workers are treated similarly the risk may be reduced It is cleanest however to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while assume we don t want to hire them all which is the other alternative Then the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive

admission of wrongdoing on Enron s part I m fine with letting go of it This has been a good learning experience for me There have been a couple of phone calls this week where I was consciously more polite with agency sales phone calls than I would have been prior to last week Jennifer had some fear up yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue which is understandable and we re working through it together I want her to be able to stay in her power with these people and we just need to learn new ways to do that It s a tough job dealing with agencies day after day really wears you down We re going to write some scripts for talking with them in the future and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me so they all get the same story We re also putting some new processes in place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future Thanks for all your help Debi Michelle Cash 08 10 2000 11 13 PM To Debi Vanwey HOU ECT ECT cc Robert Jones Corp Enron ENRON Jennifer Cronin Corp Enron ENRON Subject Re Contracting Solutions Debi Your plan sounds good to me You all have done a good job of researching this data and I believe we are in a strong position My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting resumes from them What is the harm in accepting them Are we obligated to interview the candidate Given this situation it is possible that telling them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason especially since their proven track record is only for one placement It does not appear as if they are flooding us with resumes Let me know if my assumption is not correct Also I am not sure your apology is necessary It certainly is well intentioned but I wouldn t want it to be construed as some sort of admission of wrongdoing So unless you feel compelled Thanks Michelle Debi Vanwey 08 10 2000 02 03 PM To Michelle Cash HOU ECT ECT Robert Jones Corp Enron ENRON cc Jennifer Cronin Corp Enron ENRON Subject Contracting Solutions Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro There is only one John Nguyen that works for Enron and he is at EBS This is not the same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions I talked with the Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John The John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5 4 to Keith Dziadek for an opening he had We got no response from Keith which for him is considered a no We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS He was directly recruited by Ergos presented by them and hired through them Jennifer talked with Mark and he states that he has never talked to a recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions If CS did indeed present his resume to Enron then they should be able to produce the email with date time stamp Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet I feel Robert and I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation Robert had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week and I think we should make good on the promise Here are my recommendations please give me your thoughts 1 I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone 2 Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John Nguyen based on above facts 3 Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list and CS is not on it since no one is interested in working with them We should let them know that yes they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract placement but this does not require us to accept resumes from them We accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with recruiting We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days give them a second chance and have the guidelines for the trial period well defined They should contact me directly at that time 4 We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn the difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been made and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in order to press the point They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer s decision not to employ them as a vendor 1 inadequate resume flow 2 poor working relationship with account manager 5 We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other company including Continential Shell Services and Dynegy and after addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred Nor did she did send Mark Delaro s resume to Ergos We have no reason to believe that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron nor that she will in the future 6 Cheryl Charles Maddison presented her resume to Robert and Ryan and Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks and has not claimed association with CS We have no recruiter openings at this time and she has been informed of this by Ryan and myself Debi "},{"received_time":"2000-08-11

consideration of the root cause and setting a plan to address it The real change issue as I see it is job description and position classification The real project is to rationalise the job structures within Enron simplify wherever possible Target a cut from 24 categories to say 12 This impacts not only the PRC but how we look at compensation across the levels function performed e g commercial commercial support technical and specialization areas e g legal accounting IT engineering HR etc With respect to current yearend PRC it is hard to change the agreed process midstream It is doable if we can show where how certain of the categories are equivalent and should be considered together Only caveat is to ensure we do not render the root cause untreatable by addressing symptoms Tim Gerry

value to roles in ENA commercial deal making function this is very easy to do how much they profit they generate grade has very little place in this world In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology far from perfect for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how they are valued in the organisation To lose them without providing some other method of measuring value e g a more robust PRC process would run the risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective Give me a small number of loose grades anytime So we should aim for nearer to 8 9 and head away from the 24 having 7 levels for admins does smack of bureacracy Would be interested to be involved in looking at this Neil free market radical Drew C Lynch ECT 09 21 2000

Unnecessary Hiearchy equals 10X Bureaucracy I m disappointed that we haven t followed up on the conversation we had a few weeks ago relating to the 24 hierarchical levels we apparently preside over here at Enron My view remains we should have a strong ambition to significantly reduce and simplify the current grade structures Far from adding additional levels a fundamental analysis should be made of the need for any more than 5 from top to bottom In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your comments why would the following structure not work better in promoting a flat entrepreneurial open fast paced organisation while also significantly reducing the bureaucracy Number of PRC levels Commercial Support Technical Key 1 MD VP Same Collapse 2 2 Deal Makers Management

to P&S Agreement -- Triple Lutz","recipient_address":"anne.koehler@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-10-17 23:35:00-07:00","message_body":"Anne I have reviewed the P S Agreement for Triple Lutz From my perspective it generally looks fine I have a few comments and invite Pat Mackin to add any he may have in particular based on his review of Section 4 14 In Section 4 7 c iv there is a reference to any contract obligations I believe this would include employment contracts which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds 250K We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of Section 4 13 iii Section 4 8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law However given that closing is pushed out so far in the future we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing This may be done with the Buyer s consent but we may be tying our hands Section 6 2 e contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers directors In addition Section 4 8 states that we won t enter into or amend any employment contracts We do not renew employment contracts at a single time and the contracts of key personnel may expire Do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending extending the agreements Section 6 2 l also prohibits the modification amendment of contracts with employees In Section 4 10 the wording other than Environmental Laws suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws Rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable In Section 4 11 d we promise that we haven t provided any gift of any kind to customers I don t think we can say that given that we regularly host client development outings e g Rodeo BBQ tickets golf tourneys etc and provide Enron goodies to people all the time Perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate Also a reference to our Code of Ethics may work here In Section 4 13 a iii does the 250K threshhold include only cash value or does it include equity grants that vest over time A reference to cash payments would clarify given that people here are compensated by stock options restricted stock that vest over time In Section 4 14 d I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting Pat do you know Should Section 7 3 be italicized I have not seen the latest of the Employee Matters Agreement Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the purposes of dispute resolution Anne let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions Michelle "},{"received_time":"2000-10-17

comment on both PSA documents negotiations with both buyer s representatives and discussions with clients Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer effect of Enron severance plan other benefits for divested employees including unvested stock options insurance vacation etc process for divesture payment of severance obligations possible redeployment etc Crane monitor due diligence PSA review and comment client discussions Falcon review diligence reports client discussions E2 limited involvement in PSA and schedule review data requests Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 Triple Lutz continued negotiations and document drafting Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible East Coast Power If we sell our interest in ECP there will be many transition issues due to Enron s providing benefits payroll etc for ECP personnel Also there will be transition issues for other services including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP Crane Falcon could move forward Crane is more likely Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues Litigation Major Events of September November 2000 No employee initiated litigation for 2000 Non compete litigation Currently suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Wood s court Suit filed no TRO sought Service in process Minor litigation Marentz Co v Enron Suit for non payment of placement fee Maximum damages 75K Discovery period ends this week court ordered mediation to follow Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 I expect that we will be filing non compete litigation in February and March as people leave after they are paid their bonuses We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non compete litigation Documents Generated Major Events of September November 2000 New Consulting Services Agreement I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback I will finalize the agreement so that the new document can go into effect on 1 1 01 Standard Agreements I prepared draft employment agreements draft consulting services agreements separation agreement and releases retention letter agreements The number of employment agreements seems low to me particularly in trading My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract but wants to wait and see how they perform There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our non compete provisions Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 I expect that after bonus amounts are announced there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool Investigations Major Events of September November 2000 Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants surveys Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey Other proposals can be discussed verbally Texaco Hacker We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co worker He then sent inappropriate emails to her co workers posing as her The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRC bonus discussions Training Major Events of September November 2000 Increased role as trainer I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track about 10 sessions Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 EIM Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family All of Wholesale The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round Pre Hire Testing Major Events of September November 2000 Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre employment testing as a method of screening out applicants I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee Re Skilling One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of potential employees who may be re skilled to perform IT jobs working under Beth Perlman Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot particularly since John Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A A program Employee Relations Terminations Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations termination issues approximately 10 15 per week total No two situations are alike and they require significant time Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 After PRC bonus time this area of practice will be exceptionally busy The company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on a performance improvement plan Generally I review those before they are put in place If they are not successful then terminations are likely probably early in the first half of 2001 Those issues are time consuming and full of risks Work for Portfolio Assets Major Events of September November 2000 Ecogas wind down issues Mariner Change of Control Agreements CGAS harassment prevention training arranged for Littler Mendelson to provide training for CGAS personnel East Coast Power Agreements advice and counselling on various issues Anticipated Issues for December 2000 February 2001 CGAS Revising employment agreements for key personnel Mariner Employment agreement negotiation Conclusions ENA ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of manager and above I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring Lavorato has placed processes in place for hiring at that level including the requirement of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of manager or above Salaries need to be reviewed for equity by gender as well as by race Net Works Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000 I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be managed out Generally the IT personnel are not the best about counselling and documentation so there may be significant work to be done to ensure that risks are managed in that situation I have seen improvement in that group working with HR and they have invited me to conduct training so it may improve over time Contractors are another issue at Net Works A significant portion of the work force is contract personnel Microsoft issues could arise if contractors are allowed to stay on too long Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue Net Works has too many employees in the exempt category who should be classified as non exempt I have raised this issue with HR and they are working through it It will not be an easy fix EIM The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of talent as well as M A activity HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle diligence for EIM but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle the job EGM EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other groups within Wholesale That plus the added earnings pressures will make retention of key personnel essential I expect to see continued pressure to shorten the non compete duration for this group "},{"received_time":"2000-12-05

apply to a resignation after the end of the 2 year period In other words if I resigned in 4 years and assuming no further service contract had been put in place the company could prevent me taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was pay for that period Two other points The new paragraph in 3 4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary for the non compete period would be paid up front Would it be safer to pay monthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations Have we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non compete for resignations during the term This is not a concern to me and I am content with the existing arrangement for my contract However as a far as the precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce I will call you tomorrow to discuss "},{"received_time":"2000-12-07
