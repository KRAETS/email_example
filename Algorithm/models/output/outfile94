Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear s chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer a wildlife official told the London Free Press Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left

then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car Harry caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge was found dead by officials A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal employing a helicopter and infrared scanner Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack On July 2 of last year 24 year old

Enron Europe laying off employees Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through hence me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down Also the employee survey results I read not good enron employee consumer confidence is not good Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment hence for enron slowly dissapating Lastly I can always buy enron stock at these price levels taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank is probably easy money I can always take the money market and get back in enron sure I am forgoing getting in at 28 5 the strike price but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40 is a few thousand dollars rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show OH lastly I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w
