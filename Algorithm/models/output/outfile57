changes are reflected in the above document Let me go over your list of items 1 I have deleted the word DRAFT 2 I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the contract would be executed by the City 3 I have changed the word may to shall 4 Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point I do not think their is an omission 5 I have added the word reasonable 6 The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise the statement then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure 7 We need to limit the duration to 30 days neither party should be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party s obligations under the Contract We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure 8 I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period During a holiday period one scheduling error could cover the entire period Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any month 9 The reason is because Enron Corp is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA 10 I have changed a to the 11 I have eliminated the 60 day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure 12 This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a particular party may have caused I think the language is clear as written 13 The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were referenced I am still waiting for your language I started filling it in using language that had been provided by the City 14 I added the word reasonable 15 I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP 16 This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a party s rating as such I have kept the 2 over prime language 17 These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group BBB is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corp s rating is BBB ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corp s rating 18 The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have made If the City cannot make these representations then we need to know that before we execute the Contract 19 I have added the word reasonable 20 The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract 21 It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated We can agree to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties I am willing to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer 22 We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list Therefore we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact We believe that each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Contract I will be out of the office on Friday but will be in all next week if you care to discuss any of these matters Kolling Grant grant kolling city palo alto ca us 03 02 2001 03 43 PM To Dan J Hyvl enron com Dan J Hyvl enron com Kolling Grant grant kolling city palo alto ca us cc Kim Ward enron com Subject RE Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement 0071988 RESO Enron doc Dan First I ve attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement More importantly I need to inform you that our senior management has reviewed the referenced contract I have been asked to present additional changes to the agreement for Enron s consideration and to raise questions about certain of its terms and conditions Let me start from page 1 top to bottom and proceed to the end of the exhibits 1 There is the word DRAFT above the title of the Enfolio agreement which should be deleted 2 The introductory paragraph line 5 should not contain the words 1st of January 2001 It should be left blank until the parties have signed the contract Otherwise the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the contract because Article 2 section 2 1 requires the City to proffer the to be approved by Council resolution as of 1 1 01 3 Article 2 Section 2 4 line 2 The City Customer wants Enron Company to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction as defined Therefore the City requests the word may should be changed to shall 4 Article 3 Sections 3 1 and 3 2 first sentence Buyer s Requested Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ Seller s failure to Schedule the Buyer s Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller s Deficiency Default How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller s Deficiency Default if the Buyer s Requested Quantity does not include a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity What is the reason for the omission 5 Article 4 Section 4 1 lines 15 and 23 Line 23 refers to reasonable attorneys fees yet line 15 refers to attorneys fees To be internally consistent line 15 should say reasonable attorneys fees 6 Section 4 1 right hand column lines 3 4 A statement showing the determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared It s unclear whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination before a dispute is referred to arbitration The City should be entitled to receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is obligated to pay the Termination Payment Please clarify or permit the City to exercise these rights 7 Section 4 2 iv specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days Is this under bankruptcy laws the minimum period of time within which one may seek dismissal of a bankruptcy petition Please refer to the 11 USC section that backs up this provision or change to 60 days 8 Section 4 2 v and vi Please change 30 days to 5 days The City is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron 9 Section 4 2 ix this language discusses a default by Enron Corp ENA s parent but no mention is made of ENA s default in this regard Please explain 10 Section 4 5 line 4 Is a Company supposed to refer to the Company 11 Article 5 The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision as drafted It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event earthquake would prevent either or both parties from performing with the 60 day period stated therein There is no such limitation under California law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary 12 Article 7 Section 7 2 Could Enron translate the last sentence We don t understand it 13 Appendix 1 Act Please explain why Section 3 is referred to 14 Appendix 1 Claims line 4 Please add reasonable before attorneys fees 15 Appendix 1 GAAP This should read GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to Company and governmental generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied with respect to Customer 16 Appendix 1 Interest Rate Please delete two percent over The City has a AAA bond rating therefore the City believes the 2 over prime should not apply to it 17 Appendix 1 Material Adverse Change What does Enron believe the City s Net Worth to be The 400 million threshold is mentioned Also what is ENA s bond rating Is BBB an investment grade rating 18 Representations and Warranties Because we have agreed that the opinion of counsel will not be required the reps and warranties are being deleted But the Representations and Warranties is nevertheless included in the agreement Item i should be deleted because the City has not undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an opinion We would like to delete and vii it is not Party 19 Operational Flow Orders line 8 Please add reasonable before attorneys fees 20 Financial Matters line 8 What is meant by to the extent it has a legal right of access thereto and or etc 21 Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated We do not as a matter of legal policy agree to arbitration but we will mediate disputes Is Enron amenable to mediation This process is less formal and less costly in my opinion 22 Authority for Transactions Staff would like the Agreement to include a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on behalf of their employers Could a statement be added to this section to this effect Then we could attach the list s as an Exhibit C Thank you so much for considering these issues There are others which I hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for response Look forward

merely putting into place a three month contract we should be able to resolve the issues rather quickly If we were working on the Master I would agree that we are a long way apart Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline 1 Delete the definition of Credit Support Provider 2 Add definition as follows The term Guarantor means as to Seller Seller s ultimate parent Enron Corp 3 Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as provided in my redline to you It is the position of our Credit Department that a rating of BBB is considered investment grade and as such that is the benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered Enron Corp is currently rates as BBB 4 The changes that you made in 2 1 1 2 1 2 and 2 2 1 are okay The change that was made to 2 2 2 should be deleted 5 The change that was made to 2 3 1 and 2 4 1 is okay 6 The changes that were made in 9 1 should be removed because the sale and purchase quantity is based on the DCQ Note that all settlements under the Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to be handled between the party and its transporter 7 The change in 9 3 should be changed back to five 5 Days instead of 10 Days 5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries changing to 10 would mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a payment default 8 The change in 10 2 of at or should be restored This is a 3 month deal Seller s position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or after delivery Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal 9 All of the changes made to 12 2 12 3 and 12 5 should be removed There is no partial force majeure a party is either unable to perform because of the event or the party can perform Please explain how the loss of Buyer s market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not be required to find a new market during such period Force Majeure should only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate and collect a Termination Payment 10 The change in 14 should be deleted There is no event which would allow early termination other than a Triggering Event 11 Please explain the changes in 16 4 Seller has provided all of the notice address information that will be put in the Contract No telephone number or other address will be added 12 All of the changes made to 17 1 17 2 17 3 and 17 4 should be deleted and the original language provided in my previous redline should be restored These are requirements set forth by Enron s credit requirement and are not subject to negotiation by me 13 I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18 1 18 2 18 3 nor the addition of 18 4 however I do not believe that either party would be able to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods Please reconsider 14 The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I would forward same to Enron Corp for their consideration Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me have your

at the end of 9 1 should be deleted Any differences between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its transporter As I explained if we schedule a DCQ of 10 000 with you and the pipeline and only deliver 9 500 to the pipeline the pipeline will deliver 10 000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us Likewise if we schedule 10 000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9 500 we still sell you the 10 000 and the 500 you didn t take is between you and your pipeline transporter 2 10 3 and 10 4 need to be deleted What we agree to say was as follows 10 3 Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale In the event such representation is false then such misrepresentation shall be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to Section 17 1 3 Delete the language not otherwise due to an event of force majeure that you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12 3 4 Delete the language added at the end of 12 5 and add language after the word expired at the end of the second sentence In no event shall any event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the term of this Contract After such 10 day period the parties shall be obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been remedied and if such party does not resume performance such nonperformance shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate pursuant to Section 17 1 5 Delete item vii added in 17 2 because it is adequately covered by my inserted language in 12 5 6 The 15 000 000 changed in the 3rd line of 17 4 needs to be changed back to 10 000 000 If the exposure exceeds 10 000 000 that is the reason additional security would be required This contract contemplates that Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of 0 whereas the Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of 10 000 000 Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of payment after it makes deliveries under the contract Kim Decell kdecell gassupplyconsulting com 12 07 2000 11 51 AM To Dan J Hyvl enron com cc Subject Wisconsin Public Service contract Dan Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your 11 22 version I have summarized our differences below but I will call you at about 10 30 subject to your calendar to discuss the items Significant Differences 1 Taxes I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale I a kept our 10 3 but added sentence that no taxes currently applicable at POS and b added Sec 10 4 which we discussed gives either Party right to terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax 2 Exceptions to Force Majeure I added not otherwise due to an event of force majeure to the section addressing failure of reserves insufficient production from reserves This should clarify that if a force majeure event ie explosion occurred at Seller s supply point Seller would NOT be obligated to perform except as identified in Triggering Events 3 Billing We cannot accept Enron s requested changes It is the industry standard to bill Buyer s based on what WAS not what was TO BE delivered If actuals are not available it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ but once actuals are available prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry standard is something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract Terms were established in 8 00 Given the tremendous progress we ve made to this point I am hopeful that Enron will accept the industry standard billing on actuals for this contract We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of the future Enron WPS Master Contract 4 Credit Terms Based on our 12 6 discussion I a removed Enron s Material Adverse Change definition b removed Enron s Sec 17 2 vii regarded MAC and c added back our Section 16 10 Credit Terms whereby either Party has the right to demand credit support if in their sole and non discriminatory assessment the other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to the Contract Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering Event per Enron s language 5 Effect of Force Majeure Based on our 12 6 discussion I a removed language referring to consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17 2 Triggering Events and b added Sec 17 2 vii to make extended FM a Triggering Event 6 Collateral Requirement THIS IS A NEW REQUEST I would like to change the Termination Payment threshold from 10MM to 15MM In light of soaring gas prices WPS could find itself owing more than 10MM strictly based on standard full performance Accounts Receivable for example 15 000 MDQ 10 gas price 60 days 9MM I believe your provision was intended to keep Buyer s from having multi month A R and or non performance charges Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial obligations we should not set a threshold below potential standard full performance A R MINOR ITEMS 1 Throughout document I made changes to your comments to make consistent with form of entire document including changing Daily Contract Quantity to DCQ and putting days in words ie 20 days became twenty 20 days 2 Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ 3 Other changes that we agreed to yesterday Dan please let me know the earliest convenient time for you to discuss these items with me on the phone Thanks

apologies for replying so late I was out of town again and am back at trying to complete 5 days of work within 3 days Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries 7 Re 4 2 iv please suggest language as you ve indicated in sentence 2 Anything along the lines you ve proposed likely will be agreeable 8 Re 4 2 v and vi How about 20 days 13 Definition of Act I suggest you refer to Article 11 sections 5 and 9 of the California Constitution to be more specific Section 3 is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge though I can see how the language could lead one to cite it 21 In California the concept of binding mediation is not recognized if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I ve participated Mediation is non binding As a practical matter it can cost almost as much in terms of time money and effort to proceed to mediation but the rules of engagement are not as tight as are found in arbitration We avoid the rigid procedures I believe Enron should consider this approach at times Having gone through a couple I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal that s acceptable to the parties The cost of arbitration is not worth it That s why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration 22 I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list Surely Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions We can do the same We ve had an unfavorable experience with another Texas based energy company regarding the scope of its representative s authority We don t want to litigate the issue of due authority That list would help It s not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract because someone arguably didn t have the authority There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim Thanks Grant ","message_subject":"RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale

City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 1998 Prior to that time ENA supplied 45 000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement since they were the steam host for the facility After Calpine took over these contracts either expired or were terminated At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes Since then measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL s invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct Additionally as a result of Calpine s power purchaser s last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day which notification is usually after Calpine s next day notification deadline to HPL Calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs These notifications have occurred some thirteen I think times and Calpine has provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force majeure When pressed for a more detailed explanation they merely state that they had to take down various unit s to repair or replace leaking valves etc Clear Lake Facility The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility This may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was negotiated by ENA in 1995 Midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas Market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 1995 agreement Should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement Calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points Currently HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A S pipeline It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not

excursion Each piece of equipment had its own special place in her kit When she got to the ice she found a quiet little area placed her padded stool and carefully laid out her tools Just as she was about to make her first cut into the ice a booming voice from the sky bellowed There are no fish under the ice Startled the blonde grabbed up all her belongings moved further along the ice poured some hot chocolate from her thermos and started to cut a new hole Again the voice from above bellowed There are no fish under the ice Amazed the blonde wasn t quite sure what to do as this certainly wasn t covered in any of her books She packed up her gear and moved to the far side of the ice Once there she stopped for a few moments to regain her calm Then she was extremely careful to set everything up perfectly tools in the right place chair positioned just so everything Just as she was about to cut this new hole the voice came again There are no fish under the ice Petrified the blonde looked

true but it s still funny Subject Stupid is as Stupid Does This could be possibly the funniest story in a long while This is a bricklayer s accident report which was printed in the newsletter of the Australian equivalent of the Workers Compensation board This is a true story Had this guy died he d have received a Darwin Award for sure Dear Sir I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form I put poor planning as the cause of my accident You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient I am a bricklayer by trade On the day of the accident I was working alone on the roof of a new six story building When I completed my work I found that I had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500 lbs Rather than carry the bricks down by hand I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor Securing the rope at ground level I went up to the roof swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it Then I went down and untied the rope holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope Needless to say I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equal impressive speed This explained the fractured skull minor abrasions and the broken collar bone as listed in section 3 of the accident report form Slowed only slightly I continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of beginning to experience a great deal of pain At approximately the same time however the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel Now devoid of the weight of the bricks that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs I refer you again to my weight As you can imagine I began a rapid descent down the side of the building In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming up This accounts for the two fractured ankles broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body Here my luck began to change slightly The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked I am sorry to report however as I lay there on the pile of bricks in pain unable to move I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me This explains the two broken legs I hope this answers your inquiry Tony C ","message_subject":"Fw: Stupid is as Stupid

company and the fact that HPL had overpaid them to the tune of 328 508 61and would it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998 The 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however Killam Oil Company the operator of the wells has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company The information provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation Based on the reallocation HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97 384 MMBtu that has now been allocated to EOG I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents Upstream s attorney Ty Kelly written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction He also stated that the volumes should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract Kelly also indicated that since HPL s agreements routinely provide for arbitration the issue should be resolved through arbitration Based on my review of the information available HPL should withhold the sum of 328 508 61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved HPL needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum it will need to remit such amount together with interest to Upstream

feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance followed by a thunderous prayer meeting so I bought the sticker and put in on my bumper I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is and I didn t notice that the light had changed It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn t honked I d never have noticed I found that LOTS of people love Jesus Why while I was sitting there the guy behind started honking like crazy and when he leaned out of his window and screamed for the love of God GO GO What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus Everyone started honking I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air When I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something Well I ve never met anyone from Hawaii so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back My grandson burst out laughing why even he was enjoying this religious experience A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended but this is when I noticed the light had changed So I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning and drove on through the intersection I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared So I slowed the car down leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away Praise the Lord for

are certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company these being the contracts with Entex etc after we decide how ENA also wants to keep the right to do business with these

Majeure as not being needed because the revised 11 2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as of the date hereof which is not within the reasonable control of the party and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof all without listing specific types of events which might be considered You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the preceding sentence By example assuming that more than one transporter could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point if the transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure the Enron revision would require a party to

customers to notify their parties Therefore if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your transporter declares an OFO you will get notice and be responsible for giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification Likewise if Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notification Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure Usually the OFO notification would require
