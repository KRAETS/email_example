worth 800 billion Currently 60 of Enron s transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company s transaction costs have been reduced by 75 Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts Over the past 22 months we have successfully the EnronOnline e commerce platform to 1 Access new markets and customers In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets for example broadband paper freight metals weather petrochemicals and even financial instruments from all over the world The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face to face meetings 2 Manage high volume of products and transactions Enron does more than 5 000 online transactions in an average day Before EnronOnline a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices now s he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market driven price with no transaction fee The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron To paraphrase Smart Business September 2001 a long term gas contract that in 1981 took two years to execute and in 1997 took two weeks now takes less than a second online thanks in part to EnronOnline Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead times required to develop new systems 3 Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively The results have been widely reported in the media Internet Week October 2000 Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet having whipped its existing businesses into online ones ridden the Net into many new markets added 60 billion in revenue last fiscal year and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year Enron s second quarter net income rose 40 from the year earlier quarter to 404 Million on 196 percent higher revenue of 50 billion the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency EnronOnline now does more than 4 billion a day in trades in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine September 2001 as No 1 of the Smart Business Fifty list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business Forrester Research Forrester Report April 2001 predicts online

year A great reflection on you guys too Louise Ref Houston Chronicle website Tuesday Dec 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of We had unmatched talent and skill We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve But above all an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great Throughout the decline we did what we had always done we did our best Enron took my 401 k they took my stock options they took away the day old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office They took away my boss and my co workers whom I considered a family I loved my job and in the end they took that too Matt Hommel former Enron employee We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame At the end of it all the truth is that bad things happen For myself I humbly asked for only one thing The chance to rebuild Enron Online I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted Around 9 p m I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news In the utmost professional manner I was informed that there was no good news Now it s over I still get a bit choked up when I think about it I don t work at Enron and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets I made some good friends at Enron but I know I won t see many of them again Enron took those friendships Enron took my 401 k they took my stock options they took away the day old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5 1 despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played They took away my boss and my co workers whom I considered a family I loved my job and in the end they took that too But let me say this I have my memories I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal I am going to keep my memories They belong to me Matt Hommel Louise Kitchen Chief

brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning Contracts Structure There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline the Password Application PA the Electronic Trading Agreement ETA and the commodity contracts in the form of General Terms and Conditions GTCs or alternatively a Master Agreement The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer The other documents are accepted online PassWord Application PA The PA is a one page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty as opposed to any of the other documents which are accepted online by clicking acceptance The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs The PA signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company and approved by Netco allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log in session Upon receipt of signed PA Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre approved customers For counterparties with whom we are not familiar more time is needed to run credit legal contracts regulatory and tax check Electronic Trading Agreement ETA The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time he she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions GTCs posted online for a particular product unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place General Terms and Conditions GTC To be sent when the Buyer is known When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time he she will be presented with the relevant GTC The GTC s are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity GTC s identify termination rights provisions for security as appropriate operational conventions nominations etc payment periods tax treatments force majeure penalties for non performance etc Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required If there is a valid Master Agreement then the system will not display the GTC and the Master Agreement will apply Password Application Electronic Trading Agreement ","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2002-01-04 16:15:02-08:00"},{"received_time":"2002-01-04

to focus on over the next week are i Re start Integration Plans due on Jan 7 To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible The current restart date is January 21 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14 2002 ii Budget due Jan 3 2002 To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs some of which can be amortized iii Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 6 of the Enron South building I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11 2002 iv Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week Wednesday and Thursday Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday please help him with his requirements I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis Please forward all

maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach When given the choice your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast related symptoms such as bloating gas and cravings for sweets and can therefore interfere with weight loss Beer which contains yeast probably has the most yeast forming components of any alcohol An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice Scotch and other grain based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems Note Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar
