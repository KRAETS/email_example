ECT Subject Re Pueblo Here are some peaker data points Two LM6000 s in simple cycle configuration can be installed for between 43 m and 50 m providing a total of 80 MW Looking at a 10 year deal there is no way to recoup this value and ENA would not be willing to take the back 10 years on its books without an offtaker If EES or DOE were willing to step up for 20 years there might be an opportunity Assuming a 9700 heat rate 3 per MWh O M and NYMEX plus 0 39 for gas the spread option for a peaker at 4 Corners would be worth between 33 m and 47 m The first number represents the intrinsic value and the second is inclusive of an option premium ENA s desk EPMI would pay somewhere in between Having just inquired with the desk regarding their appetite for taking positions short 65 MW long 80 MW in Albuquerque they were luke warm Considering transmission constraints into Albuquerque their bid offer spread might run the range of the extrinsic value on the 65 MW load Depending on site conditions available infrastructure a barebones LM6000 plant could make economic sense The plant host would likely need to pay some sort of premium for generation reliability EES could sell fixed priced energy with a reliability premium to the DOE ENA would back to back the EES contract managing market price risk and economically optimizing the peaker As a stand alone market play a peaker is marginal at best By receiving value for reliability the project might have merit Based on the thin margins I am skeptical that we would want to build a plant larger than the host s load that is more MW than that amount on which we could expect to receive some sort of demand charge Ultimately the demand charge needs to make up the shortfall between EPMI s swap value and the cost of the plant Steve Enron North

Subject Re Pueblo Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John I m getting a pretty clear sense that this project isn t going anywhere as it is currently configured Just to satisfy myself though let me throw out a couple of observations for the group to react to along the lines of Steve s However section of his memo 1 Running this thing as a baseload unit won t work The fuel cost is a killer However I keep thinking about the 200 mwh 4 Corners spot price someone mentioned on the phone Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to support a peaking merchant plant How often are those types of opportunities available and could a power plant in Alb capture that upside by transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system 2 We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE DOD electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor I think we have all assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell surplus power into the grid either at 4 Corners or after N M elec restructuring into the Alb area I just found the numbers I was remembering on the conf call 1998 peak load was 63 6 mw and total annual 1998 consumption was 334 5 million Kwh By my lawyer math that is about a 60 load factor for DOE If the DOE load is only 60 L F and the plant only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds some benchmark rate 05 Kwh 10 Kwh higher the plant might run at a 30 40 load factor on an annual basis The question is can we reduce the capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit 3 Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand charge contract for only 65 mw i e DOE but sold the rest of its output into the grid only when profit opportunities arose 4 If the answer to 3 is no would ENA backstop the debt financing by signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what the government needs At what price Based on its knowledge of volatility and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners and future profit opportunities that will be available in Albuq is that just a dumb bet or would ENA get interested if someone else i e DOE split the risk and reward John how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley If we pull the plug on the project I d like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our information on why the turbines we would use can t provide acceptable economics I don t expect that we d want to disclose the swap value analysis in Steve s memo however Thanks again

D Martin ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Arnold L Eisenstein ENRON DEVELOPMENT ENRON DEVELOPMENT Steven Harris ENRON Drew Fossum ENRON Lorraine Lindberg ENRON Subject Re Pueblo John s proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our ongoing LM6000 development I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners assuming Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport This also assumes 4 70 per MWh for O M and an 8000 heat rate For an hourly 7x24 product the intrinsic value of the gas power swap is 52 5 million on a 20 year deal well below the 108 million estimate of constructing the facility A ten year swap is worth only 42 million NPV 66 m That implies a market mid price of 34 per MWh levelized over the period Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves we can determine the following 1 New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on price 2 LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year period However 1 Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that does not exist at Four Corners 2 ENA s power prices typically undersell the market 3 Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in constrained markets If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque we should be selling capacity and reliability Given the number of power critical industries in the area we could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the city Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could support several LM6000 s for power reliability that is specific to their installations I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT units Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply however the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited to existing units LM6000 s have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide real value to a utility customer Not only can the HRSG ST hinder the flexibility of the units it can add substantial capital and operating expense with little real market benefit We should also explore the ability to schedule load If the DOE wants to peak for a test would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the off peak hours Under those circumstances we might be able to cut them a break on power and provide reliability of supply Steve Thome 503 464 3708

ENRON cc tmonaldo mrg llc com Subject Richardson testimony this gets ugly Richardson says FBI has determined drives did not leave Los Alamos June 21 2000 Web posted at 3 00 PM EDT 1900 GMT By Ian Christopher McCaleb CNN WASHINGTON Two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing from the Los Alamos National Laboratories earlier this year never left the premises and the FBI has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a Senate committee Wednesday Energy Secretary Bill Richardson The two hard drives each smaller than a deck of playing cards held vital nuclear weapons secrets and were stored in a secured vault at the storied New Mexico nuclear weapons laboratory In a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing of Senate Armed Services Committee Richardson said Based upon the investigation by the FBI so far there is no evidence of espionage nor is there evidence the drives have ever left Los Alamos Richardson added that the FBI seems to be on the verge of reconstructing what happened to the drives saying Latent fingerprints were found on the scene and on the external wrappings of the drives themselves The FBI continues to comb the crime scene a room housing a copy machine and a grand jury has been convened Richardson said punctuating his statement with a declaration that a handful of so called Los Alamos X Division employees have offered conflicting statements to investigators The secretary speculated that the disappearance of the hard drives may have been an unintentional mistake by a lab employee who feared coming forward when alarms were raised I will not take disciplinary action until I have all the facts before me he said vowing I will not rest until I know what happened when where why and by whom The FBI has said the drives disappeared at the tail end of March of this year March 28 Richardson said Should the FBI s timeline prove correct reports issued at the beginning of this week that the drives have been missing since January could be called into question The two hard drives were discovered missing on May 7 when weapons scientists took an inventory of the drives stored within a vault at the laboratory s X Division as a massive wildfire approached the facility The section is perhaps the most sensitive area of the facility and is where the most classified nuclear weapons research design and development is undertaken The scientists had been tasked with checking to assure that all of the division s drives were safely within the vault in the event that the lab would have to be evacuated An evacuation was ordered the next day because of the fire threat but no one reported the drives missing until May 31 sparking a massive search of the area and deep anger in Washington The drives contain vital information on the makeup of U S Russian Chinese and French nuclear weapons They mysteriously reappeared last Friday in a room at the lab that already had been searched several times Richardson taken to task early and often Richardson s pledge to bring accountability to bear on those responsible for the missing drives was met with cold stares from committee members of both parties Members of the Senate have awaited the secretary s appearance for several days after he last week declined an opportunity to offer Senate testimony saying he wanted to wait until he had more information Sen Strom Thurmond The safety of weapons secrets has dogged Richardson for much of his tenure as Energy Secretary During his watch Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was removed from his position amid charges of spying He has been formally charged with mishandling classified information not espionage and awaits trial Members of Congress have also raised red flags over the reported sale of computers once used at the Savannah River nuclear weapons facility in Augusta Georgia Those computers two senators intimated Wednesday may have once contained classified information that could have been reconstructed by their new owners Sen Strom Thurmond R South Carolina suggested at Wednesday s hearings that some of the Savannah River computers may have been sold to the People s Republic of China Sen John Warner In his opening statement Armed Services Chairman John Warner R Virginia lined Richardson himself up for accountability saying that although Richardson has worked to change the security culture at the Energy Department and the national laboratories ultimately responsibility for ongoing lapses rests with him Mr Secretary Warner said directly to Richardson On June 23rd of last year you told this committee in this room The secretary of Energy and I quote you must be accountable and must be responsible for such security failures We are holding you accountable Warner said These incidents happened on your watch Like the captain of a ship you must bear full accountability Appearing at the hearing Sen Richard Shelby R Alabama chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence repeated his earlier calls for Richardson s resignation saying I think it s time for you to go Harsher still was the criticism leveled by Sen Robert Byrd D West Virginia a member of Richardson s own party who said Richardson s pledges to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the Senate whose trust he had lost permanently Sen Richard Shelby The horse is out of the barn Byrd said Referring to Richardson s refusal to testify last week Byrd said You ve waited and shown contempt of Congress that borders on supreme arrogance Speaking directly to Richardson a one time congressman and former Ambassador to the United Nations Byrd said You had a bright and brilliant career but you will never again receive the support of the U S Senate for any office you seek You have squandered your treasure Richardson who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee members sought to defend himself arguing that he wanted to have all the facts in hand before making a congressional appearance He added that he had made vast changes in the security culture at the department and in the nation s weapons laboratories and had put off a good many longtime employees as a consequence I ve been excoriated but if you go into the scientific and academic community I am driving scientists away He also said he has been accused of racism in the Wen Ho Lee case and has had to battle members of own party who saw regular polygraph tests for employees as a violation of civil rights Sen James Inhofe R Oklahoma suggested that the captain of the ship wasn t Richardson but President Bill Clinton who Inhofe said was responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media that have led to a relaxed careless attitude among those charged with overseeing the nation s weapons secrets Serious loss of control over classified information Also appearing before the panel was Dr John Browne director of the Los Alamos facility Dr John Browne Browne while attempting to illustrate for panel members with charts just how difficult it is to gain access to the X Division admitted that his security operatives have lost control over how classified information is handled mainly because there is no set procedure to determine who handled much of the material and when This is not an environment one can easily get into he said Still Browne said there is a serious loss of control over classified information at my laboratory adding perhaps for the benefit of committee members that he had no knowledge that the information has been compromised or tampered with From a national security perspective these are positive indications Richardson was congratulated by Sen Pete Domenici R New Mexico for ceding all weapons security issues to a newly confirmed director of a semi autonomous agency formed to assess and reformulate all security procedures Sen Pete Domenici Air Force Gen John Gordon confirmed by the Senate to helm the agency but not as yet sworn into the post will report to Richardson but will not be directed by anyone else at the Energy Department The Senate had held up Gordon s confirmation for months for unspecified reasons but he was unanimously confirmed last week after news of the hard drives disappearance was released The best thing you could do to leave a legacy for America in terms of nuclear weapons is to get this agency operational Domenici said scolding Richardson not to engage in any dual hatting and let Gordon make the changes he needs to make Warner was less congratulatory warning Richardson outright that he must honor the 1999 law creating the agency and allow it to go about its business unfettered The panel closed its session to the public and members of the media just after noon on Wednesday so specifics of the case could be discussed Domenici predicted earlier in the day that a closed session would yield much more in the way of disturbing information We could go into a closed session and you wouldn t believe the things you d hear in there he said These things have to be corrected too When proceedings ended at mid afternoon Richardson told reporters he just wanted to do his job and conclude the investigation He said the fallout from the security breach was too political adding I did not utter one partisan word in that committee Conflicting statements Initially Air Force Gen Eugene Habiger the Energy Department s top security officer and Los Alamos Lab Director John Browne said in congressional testimony that a scientist had reported seeing the two devices in the vault on April 7 a month before they were found missing and seven weeks before senior lab officials were notified Gen Eugene Habiger But sources familiar with the investigation told CNN on Tuesday that this account has come under suspicion because of conflicting statements made during interviews and polygraph tests Another individual has told investigators he went into the vault on April 27 and would have noticed if they had been missing then but does not recall actually seeing them What s clear said Goss is that there was inadequate tracking on paper of the use of the two drives which belonged to an emergency nuclear response team Members of the team known as NEST have been the focus of the FBI criminal investigation The team is trained to be ready to find and disarm a nuclear device on short notice The disks or drives are designed for use in a laptop computer and are part of an emergency response kit available to team members All 26 individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have been given polygraph tests according to Richardson Browne the lab s director has testified that security rules for the tracking of items classified as secret were eased government wide in 1992 to reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this designation In early 1993 it was extended by then President Bush to government contractors such as the University of California which runs the Los Alamos lab The policy was continued by the Clinton administration The President s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board a year ago cited inadequate tracking of secret nuclear materials in a stinging rebuke of security at the Energy Department and its weapons labs While the current Los Alamos security break likely did not involve espionage in some ways it s worse former Sen Warren Rudman chairman of the advisory board said in an interview Espionage is very hard to guard against You win some and lose some Here you ve got a situation where there is just sloppy accountability and record keeping The Associated Press contributed to this report RELATED STORIES Timeline on missing Los Alamos hard drives in question 6 20 00 Bush on Los Alamos I will bring this

P 61 346 1997 Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted Commission staff denied the blanket request but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut off dates FN29 in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive On the other hand Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public Generally the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities FN30 However in the instance case the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and thus evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services Therefore we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut off dates to be made public FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events FN30 See e g Colorado Interstate Gas Company 76 FERC P 61 291 1996 In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America 82 FERC P 61 037 1998 which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements In ANR Pipeline Co the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power Even where transportation competition exists that competition is from other pipelines

Texas Eastern Transmission Corp Docket No CP95 218 003 On January 16 Indicated Shippers and Dynegy took rehearing of the Texas Eastern order that held that pipelines do not need preapproval from FERC to acquire capacity on other pipelines Indicated Shippers and Dynegy took rehearing on the following grounds 1 The Commission order is procedurally defective in that it repeals a Commission regulation 18 CFR o 284 242 without following a notice and comment rulemaking procedures 2 The old Texas Eastern policy has been effective and has deterred the conduct it was intended to preclude 3 The Commission order ignores crucial rate impacts associated with off system capacity acquisition and 4 The Commission s references to the ability of a pipeline acquiring offsystem capacity to release that capacity under the acquiring pipeline s tariff are unclear Although the Commission s regulations do not provide for answers to rehearing requests Dominion and Duke have asked that we intervene and respond to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy s request for rehearing in order to help the Commission formulate its decision As you may remember from INGAA s marketing affiliate comments the Commission s December 14 order has a lot of excellent language in it such as statements that holding offsystem capacity does not favor marketing affiliates that INGAA wants to support If Chairman Hebert wishes

and add my initial thoughts so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems Q 1 Can TW use negotiated rate agreements for its new 150 mm d expansion A Yes Independence Guardian and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts The only restriction is that we need to always offer cost based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates We hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire 150 mm of capacity but we won t know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts I guess that means that in the cert app we just tell the commission that we will be 100 at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full 150 We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both Q 2 Can we give prospective customers a cafeteria style menu of options to steal Jeff s term like the following 1 5 yr neg rate deal at a locked in 60 plus fuel and surcharges or whatever number we decide on 2 10 y neg rate deal at a locked in 45 plus fuel and surcharges 3 15 yr neg rate deal at a locked in 35 blah blah 4 15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges importantly this option is not locked in and will float with TW s actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages A I think the answer here is yes Whatever options we come up with for 1 2 and 3 we will always have to offer 4 as well Susan and Steve Stojic please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them Otherwise this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations like a 7 yr 231 day contract at 51764 for example I m not sure that would be a bad thing but we need to think about it We need to be sure we can tell a customer no and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the 5 yr term and the 35 rate for example I think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a no substitutions policy this is sticking with the cafeteria theme but we need to be sure Q 3 If we can use the cafeteria options approach how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options A This one is hard We need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options 1 3 is solely within our discretion We don t want to be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 58 instead of 60 Susan and Steve if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option for most shippers I e could we deliberately incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals i e by offering options 1 3 at 55 45 and 40 instead of the 60 45 and 35 shown above I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to obtain 100 subscription under neg

located on Isleta land adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation Thus the power plant could be connected to DOE s existing powerline infrastructure without ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land PNM would not be necessary to move power to DOE Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power maybe this could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia reservation 3 Dennis is using Jim Slattery an ex law partner of mine in DC and ex Dem U S Congressman from Kansas as his primary contact with Bill Richardson at DOE My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship with Richardson so this seems very likely to be effective Tino reports that DOE is OK with the deal and the next step is negotiating the power contract itself Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the project will not come from the tribe so the tribe s interest will be fairly thin It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery promised DOE 4 Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says he s working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen Tino thinks he s working for the Laguna tribe but wanted us to find out who is planning a big power plant out there Is this ours PNM s El Paso Finally the next key step is obviously the economics

the numbers I was remembering on the conf call 1998 peak load was 63 6 mw and total annual 1998 consumption was 334 5 million Kwh By my lawyer math that is about a 60 load factor for DOE If the DOE load is only 60 L F and the plant only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds some benchmark rate 05 Kwh 10 Kwh higher the plant might run at a 30 40 load factor on an annual basis The question is can we reduce the capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit 3 Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand charge contract for only 65 mw i e DOE but sold the rest of its output into the grid only when profit opportunities arose 4 If the answer to 3 is no would ENA backstop the debt financing by signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what the government needs At what price Based on its knowledge of volatility and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners and future profit opportunities that will be available in Albuq is that just a dumb bet or would ENA get interested if someone else

a baseload unit won t work The fuel cost is a killer However I keep thinking about the 200 mwh 4 Corners spot price someone mentioned on the phone Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to support a

Energy called me today to say that Caithness Corp has decided to move forward with plans for the Big Sandy LLC Project To refresh your memory the project is a proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW s pipeline along Highway 93 about 2 miles outside of Wickieup Arizona I ve attached a simple bitmap below click on it and hit view indicating the location of the project relative to Transwestern s facilities Ultimately the project would be built for approx 1 000 MW of generation in two phases Phase 1 will burn approx 80 000 Dth d and phase 2 will burn an additional 120 000 Dth d Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 2002 with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2 2001 Caithness Corp based in New York is a privately held company with diverse interests including geothermal renewable electric generation facilities Coso Plant in California George reported that Caithness would like for Transwestern to build own and operate the plant with facility costs current estimate 20 3MM to be amortized vis a vis a throughput rate commitment Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso s system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever be completed Obviously we ll have to wade throught the legal regulatory issues surrounding this deal structure as well as the requisite credit assurances With respect to the former I think if we view this pipeline ownership operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated operating agreements then we re probably OK With respect to the later George assured me that Caithness can will set up a funding mechanism that would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10 He suggested either Omaha or Houston for the meeting inasmuch as he d like Drew Fossum to be present Drew I m thinking it might be easier better to have the meeting here in Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the lateral pipeline If you concur what day s do you have open that week and is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill s plane for either one or both legs of the trip down here I ll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two others to join us so we can cover a

to the Electric Industry Jim Crist a lecturer with IGT is preparing a day long seminar customized to our interests and issues Here is my top 4 list on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding of the electric industry First and foremost gas fired electric generation is the growth market for gas pipelines We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being built and who the likely customers are This involves understanding the different between utility generation and merchant plants the dynamics of siting understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically justify generation investments Second we need to understand electric utilities as customers Who is the customer these days the generator Who should we be dealing with within the utility organization What types of load patterns should we expect various types of electric players What types of services do they need We also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes compare contrast to our processes on the gas side Third we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and the implications for electric generation demand growth We need to understand the state federal jurisdictional issues We need to learn about the debates over ATC TLR locational marginal pricing price caps and control areas We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron s position in support of restructuring the electric industry unbundling transmission removing native load exceptions and avoiding prices caps and we need to understand how these debates affect GPG Fourth we need to understand electric tariffs and practices services and OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and electric The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on the gas side FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on pipelines And we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline EBBs We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices where it makes sense and on the flip side know how to argue against the imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate differences between gas and electric I ve shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customized seminar for us Please feel free to email me with any other areas of interest for the course I will keep you posted on the specific location as things progress In the meantime please make sure to save the date Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be interested

review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors Their energy segment currently owns 1 200 MW of generation through renewable assets in California geothermal at Coso wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointly owned by Florida Power Light Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup Arizona The project would be built in two phases first phase would be 550 MW with a gas load of approx 80 000 MMBtu d and phase 2 would add another 170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120 000 MMBtu d The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of Transwestern s pipeline The take off point on Transwestern would be at near valve station 1008 approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 1 The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S W 4 of Section 5 T15N R12W Mohave County Arizona There is a 500 KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City NV I ve included a WAPA map below which indicates this line Also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells They have currently dug the first two test wells each capable of 500 cfm The power plant will require approximately 3 500 cfm of water In addition to the wells the plant has several thousand acre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of 200 Project Schedule Gas

Administration WAPA There is only one endangered threatened species known to be present in the area Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline The alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the EIS to be filed next month Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation ADOT and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only a 70 ft right of way available for construction Typically pipelines require a 100 ft temporary construction easement and 50 ft of permanent right of way Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway s routing within the wash of the riverbed If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N S section line The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor The only issue there aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety and or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso s northern mainline and the yet to be constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern s mainline Transwestern s original estimate to construct a 16 lateral pipeline and meter station 20 3MM was based on the following specifications 120 MMcf d 450 psig delivery pressure 900 psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure new technology Westinghouse turbines In addition our understanding is that EPNG s system operates at a pressure 100 150 psig lower than Transwestern s In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure the design will likely change to a 20 pipeline Next Steps responsible party department Task Date Due Party Dept Pipeline Alignment 1 Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route 8 4 Matthews Chanley 2 Engineering services agreement 8 4

filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border Topock AZ prices in the last month have risen by 2 50 MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border T here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse collusion and affiliate self dealing of out of state gas suppliers and merchants Edison told the CPUC The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out of state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity It notes the complaint conservatively estimates that the anti competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 4 5133 MMBtu which was applied to SCE s August 2000 avoided cost posting to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of October and every month going forward It estimated September bidweek border prices would average 7 MMBtu If such prices were used in Edison s September avoided costs posting its Transition Formula payments to certain independent power producers will be 29 million more than the month prior the company told the CPUC No mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time ","sent_time":"2000-09-05 08:58:00-07:00","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-09-05

question about what s going on in California I ve done some reading and here are my thoughts The Nov 1 FERC order in Docket No EL00 95 000 in which the Commission ordered a 150 MWh price cap among other things was predicated on the Commission s authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act Specifically the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that any rate charge or classification for jurisdictional services or any rule regulation practice or contract affecting such rate charge or classification is unjust or unreasonable the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge classification rule regulation practice or contract that should be in effect The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction but fixed the areas within its jurisdiction Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission s jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable In any event if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates its authority to do so would be much clearer The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable Just and reasonable has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means As we all know too well the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably However my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above max rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal struck within a pipeline s tariff authority to be unjust and unreasonable The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200 300 increases in their electricity bills The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state By contrast TW s transport rates for its short term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice It is far from being a consumer issue and besides the elections are over However as you and I have already discussed we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC s attention We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals Kathy why don t you and I discuss a system of

there any such laws applicable to our business Cal state law would probably be the best place to start 2 could the political regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing I e if the CPUC whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power its not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U S congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to 14 MMBtu as happened on Friday If that happens its just another small jump to whack us for charging 1 for transport or so the logic goes I d like to hear preliminary views by

I expressed in the attached email is that the sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis If Gas Control verifies that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps get line pack to optimal levels such sales are appropriate Gas Control should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented if the need ever arises Today s deal is a great example

ET S Enron ENRON Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron ENRON cc Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Subject TW Fuel This morning I raised a concern regarding TW s sale of excess fuel at downstream points Here s the problem the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points With rare exceptions those receipt points are not at the Cal border Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point x it should resell the gas at point x and not haul the gas to point y and then sell it there as a delivered i e bundled product My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement because the Cal border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location or the furthest upstream point requirement or both Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at a point other than Permian pool we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it I haven t confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn t just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it we needed someone to pay us to transport it Irrespective of what we did with ECS I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation We receive fuel at the shippers receipt points Once we receive it however it is no longer fuel It becomes line pack until it is burned Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons including shipper imbalances etc It also obviously has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel It is our job to manage line pack and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short and sell it at locations where we are long If we end up long at the Cal border from time to time we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels I wouldn t want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal border but thats not what we are talking about here I can t think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline MKM OK with you DF ","sent_time":"2000-11-29

railroads do out west we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate In other words the RR would be treated just like any other landowner If we did that Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war Since our lines cross or parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth that would be foolish I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW without too much pain If the RR option doesn t pan out we may want to suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this Assuming we can t come up with some magic contact with the RR I propose that at the appropriate time we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW should be

posting of available capacity on TW In representing to participants at the TW Options technical conference that shipper call options will not be sold on capacity that is subject to a ROFR our underlying assumption I believe was that capacity subject to a ROFR isn t posted as generally available either Jeff Lorraine and I just learned that this is not the case Our generally available posting system does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity that is subject to a ROFR all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial contract term Therefore we have capacity posted on our website that is subject to the current shipper s ROFR and that is therefore not really available We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted space Jeff s initial reaction was no that space isn t available But when we checked the posting there it was The commercial people instantly recognized it as space currently subject to a contract that contains a ROFR My recommendation is that we modify the posting procedure to NOT post capacity until we know that capacity is unsubscribed after we jump thru all the ROFR hoops The premature posting of that capacity is at best confusing to our customers who might count on getting the space by bidding maximum rate I realize that modifying our system might involve additional time and cost but I think it s

general counsel of El Paso corp called me to see if the Enron Pipeline would be willing to file in support of their hourly firm filing She called because she said that our pipelines are on record as saying that pipelines need flexibility to serve electric generators Protests are coming from the Dynegy Indicate Shipper crowd that claim that pipeline can provide hourly flexibility within current FT A technical conference is set for next Tues either Nancy or Jan will cover I told Margarite that I would see whether I could drum up any support for an ETS intervention and comments in support I told her that any ETS comments would at most be brief and state general support for the notion that pipeline need flexibility to serve electric generators I also told her that I doubted that we could file by next Tues Let me know what you think Personally I see some value from cooperating with El Paso on this issue FYI I will separately fax you a copy of the proposal to be discussed at the next INGAA Generator roundtable meeting next Tues here in Houston For the most part the proposal is more of the same tone we should be able to serve generators under existing services ","sent_time":"2001-01-18

the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial team could in my opinion use some clear written guidance on gray areas under the tariff ought to be interpreted Here is my

customer or a group of customers and pitching a deal I think we have a lot of discretion here after all using the telephone to talk to one customer is always selective since there s only one guy on the phone not all our customers Also can we deliberately leave a customer off the list of the usual suspects we call to pitch a special deal like an index to index deal or a discount I ve asked Lee to pull together a quick analysis of this issue 2 If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open season context how do we allocate it This is the situation we got into a couple of weeks ago on the 02 and 03 space Are we always required to use a lottery Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata or can we use pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance 3 What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate contracts The ET S discount approval procedure still applies to TW discounted deals even there is no ET S anymore I think all neg rate deals should be approved by law and regulatory but I don t need to see max rate strd language deals 4 I think there was another issue but I can t remember what it was Thanks for your input on

discounted rate Originally this deal was going to be entered into via EOL I input the deal s terms into CMS contract system under this assumption Oneok was a first time EOL participant and they had system problems when attempting to accept the EOL posting With the on time nom deadline fast approaching I decided to switch the deal over to a standard TFX agreement Since EOL deals are pre approved the deal had already been manually routed at my request so it could be activated per our standard EOL process This deal was required to route due to the Demarc DP all other terms were standard and within the Marketer s approval level At the point I decided to switch the deal over to a TFX deal from an EOL deal it was impossible to re route for approval I advised Danny and Drew of the change and they signed off on the CAF form I then called Ranelle and advised her of the switch from EOL to TFX but she was not given time to review the agreement The deal was then faxed to the Shipper signed returned activated and nominated prior to 11 30am The deal got done but not within our standard procedures The window between a deal being struck and on time noms a factor in the deal s value is constantly shrinking leaving no room for error Hopefully the Contract Process meeting scheduled for next week will address some of these issues If anyone has additional questions I ll try and answer

Thursday rehearing order dramatically changes how the shipper must have title rule applies to acquisitions of upstream capacity I thought the Dec order pretty clearly allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity under the acquiring pipeline s rate schedules FERC specifically held that the shipper must have title policy won t be applied if the acquiring pipe treats the acquired capacity as though it were part of its own system p 61 886 The Dec order even cited TW s acquisition of park n ride capacity from PG E as an example of the type of transaction that I thought could be done without advance Commission approval Now FERC explains that it did not intend a blanket waiver of the shipper must have title policy Pipes can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission but only if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational needs or to resell under the selling pipe s release mechanism If the acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service under the acquiring pipe s rate schedules a specific waiver of the must have title policy is required see FN 20 and text We are right back to where we started I guess the orders signal that FERC is much more likely to grant waivers of the must have title policy than in the past but I don t think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage for example and resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first Shelley let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other pipes This might be worth chasing on rehearing since

for Feb 20 1 MOPS Suggested that the MOPS rehearing be brought to Madden s attention As a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite Spent much of the week reviewing the MOPS proceeding up to date reading pleadings and cases Drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for comment While it is not very compelling for expedition it is a way to get the proceeding brought to FERC s attention Apparently there is a push to clean up old dockets Also it brought to my attention that Northern in this proceeding proposed to sell to Enron Gulf Coast Gathering which I had forgotten so that if we find another purchaser the filing will have to be amended Also the Enron affiliate made the filing for the declaratory order Kim Wilkie and were talking about MOPS and what needs to be done while she is out on maternity leave We were talking about the waiver and ROFR agreements which John Goodpasture is getting executed We need to review whatever was done if anything at the time of the original filing to sell to the affiliate Also take a look at the current ones to see if they would be broad enough to cover not only Northern but a subsequent sale by Northern afilliate if we should want to handle the sale of MOPS in that manner 2 Attended the South End Task Force Meeting Tuesday morning It was a long meeting and quite productive It was a brain dump by the south end commercial guys for Shelley and Mike and a man named Mike Gadd who called in from London who will work with Danny McCarty on asset deals It was decided to go ahead and start presenting potential deals to various Companies who we think would be interested in the various south end assets For exampleBob burleson is going to present a deal for some Permian assets to SPS SPS will have to divest certain power plants but still would like to maintain some control SPS may be interested in purchasing the pipelines form Northern and TW that currently serve the plants SPS would operate the line as an intrastate Hinshaw We think these asets are a good candidate to get Stans approval since they are not useful to get gas to California and the COS is 18 and incremental revenue is 2 3 I will be involved in putting the proposal together starting with confidentiality agreements Shelley believes that we should actively package and seek out potential interested buyers For example approach Duke about the Hugoton area because Duke has a huge helium plant there Also talk to El Paso because of its recent acqusition of CIG and ANR and interest in getting Rocky Moutain gas to Cailf Also seek out those interested in the Beaver assets and go make a pitch I am reading the existing contracts we have with Oneok as well as GPM Duke to determine any adverse terms and conditions which could hinder a sale

1999 If EOTT is named as a defendant we intend to file a cross claim against Tex New Mex In that cross claim we intend to allege fraud and gross negligence by Tex New Mex in the clean up of that release and the subsequent representations to EOTT regarding the cleanup Please let me know by Wednesday Feb 28 at noon if you have any issues with EOTT s claim against Tex New Mex If I do not hear from you I assume there are no issues Thanks for your response Molly Sample General Counsel EOTT Energy Corp 713 993 5027 fax 713 402 2806 ","sent_time":"2001-02-27

cc Subject negotiated rates on TW My experience with the February deals this week has shown me that we need to improve our system of communication on negotiated rate deals I think a simple checklist for the marketers legal reg would help Here s what I suggest Marketer Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language E mail draft of contract to Glen Mary Susan Mary Kay and Drew for information and for sign off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper Mary and Susan have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing needs to be made and if so when If a filing does not need to be made immediately note filing date on both Mary s and Susan s calendars and on Filing Log Marketer Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow Once contract is executed immediately 1 fax it to Mary at 402 398 7006 and 2 make sure the contract representative Linda Trevino knows that it is a negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report Mary Susan Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report Mary Glen Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate language Send to D C for filing Let me know if I ve left anything out and I ll get this edited spiffed up etc and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all other future deals without a hitch ","sent_time":"2001-02-28 09:00:00-08:00","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2001-02-28

couple of additional thoughts on this morning s conversation 1 if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and receipt point capacity issues why not bet the whole farm and try to hold onto the whole 150 mm d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived value goes up We could tell Calpine no on their bid and hold them off for several months negotiating if that s what we thought would lead to the best value I don t personally think this would be a prudent approach but its where our logic leads in the extreme so we d better be prepared to explain why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart 2 We ll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids that come in over the next 6 8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm d for awhile I ve thought about it a bit more and I m pretty sure you re not going to like the answer First FERC says we ve got to have a recourse rate in place for all capacity new or old One reason is that there needs to be a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases We have the option on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new incrementally designed rate We are going with the existing tariff rate on RedRock Fine but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all purposes FERC s logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock capacity at recourse rates currently 38 and never suffer a revenue shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW s overall rates because the costs of all TW s facilities including the new project will be considered in the next rate case Think about it our rates will only go down in the future if the ENTIRE cost of service goes down We d never lose money on RedRock but we might not make as much as we could have made with an 15 year fixed 38 negotiated rate There is another approach We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid right now for the 60 mm d and just flat out sell it to them That would send a pretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines The downside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the same mess that El Paso finally got themselves out of with Amoco Dynegy and the whole gang beating the crap out of us I m not to fired up about this approach for that reason I ll give you a call Monday after I ve picked our best regulatory brains on these issues DF

that is still a possibility let me pass on something we may want to follow up on I called an old law partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business this week to have lunch and catch up This guy says he has come up with a good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap He s got an 80mw nameplate simple cycle project two frame 6 turbines under development in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in service on July 1 Pretty quick work compared to other projects I ve seen Here s his racket 1 He gets used first quality turbines that have been well maintained His Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from Tokyo Electric he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in typical electric utility gold plated style He didn t say but I suspect there is no warranty on the units Obviously this isn t a bold new strategy but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used equipment 2 His siting permitting strategy is to use brownfield sites i e existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some existing air emissions sources His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp of America plant on the Great Salt Lake Magcorp is an ex client of mine and I know it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues Our compressor sites in contrast are not major emissions sites but may have some other things in common with this strategy 3 Here s a mysterious one he says the financing is backstopped by the site owner Magcorp in his project potentially us if we do a TW project but the corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated as a non controlled non affiliated entity for air permitting purposes That means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions source as the host site I m not sure how whether this works in a TW scenario but it might be worth looking at We d need to make sure that any power plant deal we chase doesn t screw up the timetable on the RedRock expansion application at FERC MKM if we could preserve the separate source concept for air permitting purposes could we even start work on developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we have a FERC certificate in hand Let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this I m having lunch with this guy on Mon and will probably learn more The thing he is proudest of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of installed capacity the project is expected to pay for itself

think TW feels it s emotionally vested at this point I will ask the Facility Planning folks to get started on providing a more detailed budget quality estimate of the cost to construct the interconnect and metering station With recent changes in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery points TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past Therefore the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put together the estimate as well as the documentation we ll need in order to implement a new delivery point on the system To this end I see the following documents 1 Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the budget quality estimate This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls out of the project 2 A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the reimbursement by Big Sandy for TW s construction of the tap and or metering station This agreement would also provide for TW s operation of the metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to avoid the CIAC 3 An Operator Balancing Agreement OBA a standard tariff form agreement defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month From a timeline standpoint we can be in the position to get these documents completed within a relatively short time 30 60 days depending on whether there are any sticking points in our negotiations By the way the only agreement that may take some time to work through is no 2 on the list although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system this past year we ve already done a lot of the lawyering spade work Not that I m especially found of meetings but it s been a while since we ve met to discuss the physical

to its system which will result in at least 50 000 MMcf d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec 2001 TW s shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles The issue is this One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers rather than let existing shippers move primary points This will help to sell out the expansion space I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions to see if it gets us anywhere I ll let you know what I find If you have comments in the meantime please let me know We may need to set up a conference

Hyatt ET S Enron Enron Lorraine Lindberg ET S Enron ENRON cc Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron ENRON Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Maria Pavlou ET S Enron ENRON Subject Pueblo I heard from Tino this afternoon and here s what s going on 1 Tino has been focused exclusively on right of way issues He s been flying around in helicopters etc and not worrying about much else They ve got environmental people already doing non field work on possible routes like checking for available turtle studies and cultural resource stuff Dennis has been focused on the political angles apparently and has purportedly gained some additional intelligence about PNM s effort to get DOE to re up their contract for a new two year term Tino says DOE told PNM to pound sand and will continue to take service under month to month rollover of the existing PNM DOE contract until some alternative i e Dennis comes along 2 Tino wants to get deeper into talking to us about possible deal structures very soon This topic includes at least three things 1 how to structure the ownership of the pipeline to maximize Enron and Dennis finincial upside 2 how to structure ownership of the power plant and related facilities to maximize Enron and Dennis financial upside while satisfying DOE on Indian ownership and 3 how to streamline the regulatory approval process An example of the concerns Tino and Dennis are focused on is if the pipeline has a regulated rate of return but the power plant has to share profit with the Tribe ownership entity where do we put the bulk of the return Also of concern is how we cut Dennis in on a slice of upside stock in Enron Profit sharing on the power plant or pipeline ownership entity Something else 3 What do the economics look like This is obviously a threshold question that we ought to be moving toward an answer on for ourselves even if we aren t in a position yet to share the information Specifically given what we know about the likely cost of the pipeline and the likely capital cost and heat rates of the turbines ENA has available and what we know about forward gas curves and what we know about how much power PNM supplies to DOE and at what rate from the document Tino gave us in KC and PNM s tariff do we think we can build this thing and beat PNM s current price to DOE Can we beat it by 10 Can we beat it by 10 and have enough to sweeten the deal for the Tribe partly because that would make it more attractive to DOE I suggested to Tino that he ought to put together a list of the issues that they are working on and that they think we should be working on and what the critical path issues and decisions are If we do the same then we d be in a position to get another meeting together and have a productive agenda and find out if this project has real potential or not Bottom line I think if our analysis of question 3 is that we can hit decent RAROC numbers and still undercut PNM s existing DOE contract and cut the Tribe in on a decent share of the power plant upside we ought to move forward aggressively DF ","sent_time":"2000-02-18 01:49:00-08:00","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-02-18

spoke to Dennis Langley yesterday about his ideas on the financial stake he is looking for in the project There are several items which will need to be included in our economic analysis as they will burden the project The conditions are as follows Dennis needs wants to recover the O M for his idea generating group which he estimates to be 2 to 3 million per year Share with Dennis a 50 50 split of any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of additional capacity sold to serve these markets A 50 50 split of any revenue received on the new line which is built The Native American tribe s will receive 25 of ownership in the assets and 25 of the cashflow stream after payout he mentioned something about an IRR of 8 being the threshold His general feeling was that the pipeline should be a 50 50 joint venture but the gas fired generation plant would be ours James will need to run the numbers but my uneducated guess says that if things were slim before these financial hits will certainly render the project uneconomic especially the 2 to 3 million year extra O M He did indicate that they are having very good conversations with the DOE and would expect to sign a contract in April I am somewhat puzzled by what he could commit to since he would have no idea what rates he could charge for the electricity or gas transportation I told Dennis we would follow up with him shortly In the meantime we will be working with Mark Baldwin to scope out the opportunities in New Mexico ","sent_time":"2000-03-07

granting Dennis ROW lease for the power plant as well as the pipeline The power plant could be located on Isleta land adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation Thus the power plant could be connected to DOE s existing powerline infrastructure without ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land PNM would not be necessary to move power to DOE Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power maybe this could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia reservation 3 Dennis is using Jim Slattery an ex law partner of mine in DC and ex Dem U S Congressman from Kansas as his primary contact with Bill Richardson at DOE My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship with Richardson so this seems very likely to be effective Tino reports that DOE is OK with the deal and the next step is negotiating the power contract itself Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the project will not come from the tribe so the tribe s interest will be fairly thin It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery promised DOE 4 Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says he s working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen Tino thinks he s working for the Laguna tribe but wanted us to find out who is planning a big power plant out there Is this ours PNM s El Paso Finally the next key step is obviously the economics Based on what Tino told me I m convinced that Dennis and Tino don t have a real good sense of how much might be in this deal They are groping a bit and our initial analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight How are those efforts coming Thanks DF 4 ","sent_time":"2000-03-16

21 2000 05 01 PM To Mary Kay Miller ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject daily firm on TW The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one day terms as the FTS 1 agreement renews but not beyond a specified date Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3 month term I see no basis for this limitation The term of the FTS 1 agreement is one day renewable from day to day The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS 1 agreement renews If the FTS 1 agreement does not renew the discount is no longer applicable The basis for the shipper s transportation rights is the FTS 1 agreement We are not guaranteeing a shipper daily firm for longer than a one day term The discount letter merely states that for so long as the FTS 1 agreement renews a particular discount applies up to a certain cutoff date Does this make sense I realize you are swamped but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board Thanks ","sent_time":"2000-03-23

Glen Hass ET S Enron ENRON sstojic gbmdc com Mary Darveaux ET S Enron ENRON cc Lorraine Lindberg ET S Enron ENRON Subject Re holding capacity on PNM Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in order to make this filing While it is true that one of the reasons FERC rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on unspecified pipelines was because it was too general the Commission never stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the Texas Eastern requirements I believe that the filing is specific enough to address the Commission s concerns because we have narrowed it down to a specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a constraint on TW s system The Commission did not require us to have an agreement with PG E for Market Center services and in fact we did not have a deal in place when we made our filing While I m sure it s true that having a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing the Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully employed in our Market Center services filing On the Hinshaw issue I will forward you the relevant e mail chain from last week From Mary

with PG E our West flow capacity is sold out Therefore there is really no means to compare the USGT alt flow rights with an opportunity cost for unsubscribed firm capacity Moreover the receipt points under the USGT deal are not on the San Juan Lateral so any alt West flow transportation will be marked against a Permian Cal Border price spread However your instincts are probably correct regarding

the numbers we got from Mark Baldwin is this where we are 1 The overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant At most we could assume maybe 5 000 10 000 day of gas load from industrials near the airport and another X 000 from Kirtland s gas load This assumed load will ramp up over several years or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are and not be available immediately 2 We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE Its probably 0 042 KWh less 15 20 to make it attractive or maybe 0 056 less 15 20 Either way a low rate 3 We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline about 17 mm in the 16 configuration without the Isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant Maybe about 20mm total 4 We don t have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to Palo Verde so I d suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at Palo Verde Are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing Ercot Pub Serv Colorado 5 I m not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics but to my non business guy mind the following scenarios or something similar stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense A Worst Case Assume we build a 75 mw power plant i e assume no extra power to sell in spot market and assume we get the Kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers Baldwin talked to If the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that Enron could live with based on our internal hurdle rates can we hit the DOE target power price and have any left over I suspect this scenario is upside down Should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant combined cycle and simple cycle B Mid Case Assume we size the power plant at 150mw or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense and that we sell the surplus power at Palo Verde prices less Albequerque Palo Verde transmission costs Again assume no incremental gas load except Kirtland If the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate Enron can live with does the power plant make enough to make the project work C Wildly Optimistic Case Same as mid case except add Baldwin s gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when NM gas restructuring kicks in in 2003 did I get the year right Also start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the Palo Verde spot sales at whatever year NM retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in also 2003 I think With optimistic assumptions like this does it make sense Tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of May Ideally we ll have a feel for the above relationships and the transmission constraint situation by then Thanks DF ","sent_time":"2000-04-11

the combination of significant Native American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price that is lower than DOE s current PNM rates will satisfy the public interest standard Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall structure of Dennis proposal I am surprised that Dennis would go this far before hearing from us on the economics but Tino made it sound like the initial discussions would be fairly general i e to explain to DOE that the plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole thing in partnership with the Isleta Tribe but without talking about specific economic issues Sounds to me like Dennis has Richardson on board but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people what a great

the Albuquerque region and he offered the following observations First he indicated ENA has evaluated numerous projects in that area including participation in the Cobisa project They always come to the same conclusion which is that the project economics become non workable due power grid constraints and the inability to negotiate a long term wheeling arrangement with PNM He felt like the only reason Cobisa could go forward was due to PNM being the purchaser of power from the project We talked about lower the delivered cost of gas to the facility through a zero return pipeline but in the end what the generation facility would have to compete with is power from and around Palo Verde He is very familiar with the ENA model in fact he could calculate various electric costs immediately just based on some parameters I mentioned to him over the phone In the end he felt like ENA would not want to participate because the risk of having to sell the excess power at a competitive rate was just too great given the cost to get it to a market We will continue to give the Pueblo project a final look by talking to Plains and Four Corners but without the baseload generation the pipeline

here are my thoughts on the call to Foglar Hey Murray this is Drew We received the Chisos complaint and I thought I d get ahold of you and see if there is any appetite at Duke to sit down and discuss resolving these issues in lieu of spending a lot of money on motions in Pecos County Grunt I am curious whether the pleading is evidence that Duke Chisos are not interested in resolving this outside the courts or is it just a natural reaction to our letter a move to bring Northern to the table Grunt Is Chisos serious about litigating this Grunt If Northern and Duke were to get together in the next 3 weeks do you think it would make sense for Chisos to also attend Who do you think Duke would send Grunt Do you think Chisos would hold off on serving the petition pending discussions I can t think of much else to say ask jrt ","sent_time":"2000-05-03 01:08:00-07:00","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-05-03

Tino gram DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a 7 06 mo demand charge per KW in addition to the 053 kwh energy charge Tino didn t know whether that was per KW of monthly demand per KW of non coincident peak usage or what The PNM tariff for govt service is priced at 7 16 KW of demand above 10 000kw during peak period peak period is daytime so I assume that is how it is calculated If that is the tariff Schedule 4000B under which DOE really takes service this is interesting because that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate It is also interesting that DOE is paying 053 kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B energy rate is 05072 kwh maybe the difference is surcharges or something Tino s consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an incremental 011 in addition to the 053 kwh energy charge for a total delivered PNM rate to DOE of 064 kwh This is not as good as the 7 cent number Tino threw around earlier in the week but its still not terrible If the bogey is a 10 reduction to the current rate our number to beat is 0576 kwh Tino promised us copies of DOE s actual energy bills to confirm these numbers That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you and I talked about yesterday Kevin Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta s consultant that the Cobisa Belen project is dead Do we know anything about this

Federal Solutions today to talk about Langley s sole source procurement strategy with DOE I hope to get Votaw on the phone with Langley s D C govt contracts lawyers to discuss their theory We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole source strategy is really a high risk approach I m not sure where that would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE into opening the power plant up for bids Langley does not appear interested in trying to win an open bid for the power plant although frankly we would probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning Once we clear up the government contracts issues if ever it seems to me that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions potentially if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland outsourcing strategy and ENA The ENA involvement would be particularly important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the specifications economics that would result I m probably engaging in wishful thinking again but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine heat exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics from the model that James ran If we think this thing is a potentially viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team we need to grab Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA from the bottom up

venture agreement with the Isleta I took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal including structure issues without knowing whether Enron is even on board I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant and that we have not obtained ENA s agreement to commit turbines Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out Enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money turbines etc If Enron does eventually decide to get into this deal the

of the Commissioners assistants The timing of the meeting is to ensure that we get to them prior to a press release The approach is decidely low key There is a feeling that if we make a big deal of this with FERC then they will ask a lot of questions about why we aren t filing for permission Hopefully if we explain that it doesn t change any of our current practices that its just a new computer tool they will chalk it up as another ecommerce story I hope to talk about the GPG s use of EOL generally and not get deep into the mechanics of the specific TW auction The advantage of me doing the FERC briefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I m not privy to the details of each of the pipelines possible EOL products Attached is a rough outline of my message points and a few Q As

Rep. Letter","recipient_count":"2","email_attachment":null,"message_body":"I reviewed the latest draft of AA s management rep letter and caught a few innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal I attach a revised draft of the letter with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think we need to make to keep it accurate First AA only listed two of the four agreements that comprise the deal They apparently forgot that we had created a second SBA Additionally at Transcanada s request we put the transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year You will recall that last year Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA Second AA s bullet no 4 as originally drafted states that Northern does not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term of the agreement That statement is confusing given that Article VI B of the Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is a form of purchase option That cash out mechanism was in Kent s bullets describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA looked at so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful in drafting bullet no 4 My simple fix was to leave AA s language alone but to add an except for reference at the beginning of bullet no 4 Third AA s draft of bullet nos 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous references to other agreements and additional agreements respectively Since AA s list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete these references in bullet nos 5 and 6 were also innacurate Now that I have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete I ve clarified the bullets by adding the other than those agreements referenced above language to both bullets The couple of other changes in bullet 5 simply clarify the meaning Finally I ve modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to delete MKM and myself I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time Additionally Bill s thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports anyway so it doesn t serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the top guy has signed Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these matters

on an optimal forum the key step before filing a lawsuit is the assessment of our probability of success for different reasons than is usually the case We need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment against El Paso against the probability and extent of collateral damage to our defense not just TW but all of GPG in Quinque et al 2 I like our case a lot based on what I ve seen so far if I ve got it right our claim is that El Paso breached the 1990 measurement agreement by not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to arise and remain uncorrected for so long Under the NM statute we may get 6 years worth of recovery or more I guess if they did something to toll the SOL Under the Texas SOL maybe less Do we have a good argument that the 1 standard in the measurement agreement and the 2 standard in El Paso s tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability Seems to me that El Paso will argue that the FERC tariff preempts our contract rights but I think the law is on our side there 3 The tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim against El Paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the Quinque mess If so how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros and cons I m glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking As usual I ll try to stay on the sidelines and nod

report and I will get you a final copy this week I think one will be available shortly There is an implementation meeting in Alb tomorrow From TW s standpoint a few issues stand out First producers and others joined in our frustation with the native American access issues I did not raise them but they came out loud and clear from the producers which I thought was fine Accordingly the Townhall has recommended that our Congressional delegation use their bully pulpit power to call a summit with the energy industry and the indian nations to discuss right of ways access taxes development and other issues I would think that TW would want to be involved in this if not a leader in this Second the townhall noted that pipeline infrastructure may need upgrading in the state There are other issues that affect TW not as directly but that you should be aware of I will continue to be on the implementation team and I can bring your issues along and keep you up to date as well At some point it may be appropriate to bring in TW or ETS folks as the action items move forward Tom Rutherford is another resource that Tim used and that we can consider as things develop Let me know if you need

up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th He is going to pitch the project as an approximately 100 mw power plant to be owned by read financed by DOE with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and or third parties read Enron Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get a more than 10 cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas load How did he do it Very easy they ran the power plant economics using about a 2 00 gas cost instead of current real world prices Dennis argument is going to be I ll take the risk on building the pipeline and the power plant at a capped cost and then sell the power plant to you You take the risk on gas cost if gas cost tracks the 18 24 month average you will realize your 10 cost savings but if current fuel costs continue or escalate you lose Either way your reliability improves and you kick PNM in the shins Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on this By the way their current story on Richardson is that he won t resign and won t be forced out by the administration because that would create even more publicity You ll love this they think Richardson is even more likely to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC They think his real angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor out there Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly I ve asked Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together to give to Tino to confirm whether his 2 price is wacky Other than that I just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the project if the risks and rewards make sense and that EE CC might be interested in the design build on all of it He said he d get back to me after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead DF

Approval Request Drew I ve looked at this and it is fine really does not deviate from what we have posted before One issue that arose Friday was whether our all or nothing approach i e shipper must take all 49 000 dth of capacity or none at all or all 20 000 or none at all constitutes tying The 49 000 package includes 35 000 to North Needles and 14 000 to Topock So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now and has been posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we d sell it to them without making them take the Topock space That ll be true during the IOS too i e nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process This is just a situation in which we re putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package Does this make sense to you If not give me a call From Drew Fossum 07 17 2000 01 35 PM To Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON cc Subject Transwestern IOS

weather hedges spark spread swaps and similar industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX Chicago Board of Trade etc He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of products The current strategy he explained was to solve the problem of the CFTC s arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were being sold i e the FERC as to energy

Project Bullets","recipient_count":"1","email_attachment":null,"message_body":"Great looks like a good start at working through this project I ve got a couple of thoughts questions etc that I d like to discuss with you all before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response 1 What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization This deal will not be 100 subscribed for several years optimistically as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing GCNM customers and new power generation load but that part of Tino s story needs more thinking The rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed right We need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years Has GPG ever done deals like that 2 On the GCNM discounting issue it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks a What do GCNM s current discounts look like b How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass i e are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts c Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM tries to undercut the project or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard 3 Assuming we don t have the risk appetite to get in on a project like this how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for Langley s project I assume that if neither TW nor El Paso partner with Langley he ll interconnect with both Do we already have or can we create any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario 4 Is the right of way that Langley has negotiated really all that valuable From Lorraine s memo it seems that the issue of which route is best is half baked at best If that s all Dennis brings to the table not counting his big bag of does a deal with him really make sense I m sure there are a lot of other issues we need to discuss but these are the first that come to mind Please give

2 Facility Planning provided Level A 30 cost estimates for 3 separate routes Two of which were brought to us by Langley the third Facility Planning identified as being a shorter cheaper route 3 Economic Analysis was run on the three options The attached spreadsheet details project rates and costs 4 Current PNM tariff transmission rates indicate higher rates than potential Albuquerque project rates We know that PNM discounts deeply when necessary to keep a customer from leaving its system but we don t know definitively We continue to research current discounted rates 5 The initial take on the feasibility of this project is good enough to forge ahead Please call me if you have any questions and as to our plan to respond to Tino Thanks Lorraine ","sent_time":"2000-01-11

negotiate the price specific contract language etc hopefully within 2 3 weeks of turning Mike loose 2 Regulatory assisted by Maria and me flanges up the FERC abandonment filing and tees it up to file the minute Mike finalizes the deal with Hanover We haven t talked about this for a while but the story we tell FERC has to acknowledge that the monthly O M cost will be higher under our outsourcing deal than it currently is if load factor and other operating assumptions remain constant That may be the key to our story line we argue that outsourcing is necessary to creating flexibility in our cost structure to protect us and our ratepayors from market changes gas flow changes and capacity turnbacks The Compression Services Agreement as it is currently drafted has a two part demand commodity rate Thus if our throuput goes to pot on the segments where these outsourced compressors are or if we have big capacity turnbacks the outsource deal allows us to shed costs quickly Charlie s preliminary cost spreadsheets seem to me to support this strategy I ll talk to Maria and MKM s team about this Also we need to be able to explain to explain that our deal is not all that new or radical It is just a tiny bit different from the many deals FERC has seen where compression or other services are outsourced from the get go with new facilities For example FERC allowed NNG to outsource compressor motor operation and ownership using ECS and by tomorrow hopefully will allow TW to do the same at Gallup Florida has a similar deal as well as intrastates like HPL Maria and I and MKM s folks need to turn over every rock to find examples of similary outsourcing that don t involve Enron We need to let FERC know that the outsourcing train has already left the station and we just want to jump on board 3 We get the abandonment order in the 4th Q and do the deal Will we have the chance to do some more schmoozing and lobbying of FERC folks before we file i e at a prefiling

peak period demand charges Instead of creating such a system which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor CD s system peaks ourselves

year amort basis remember DOE can only sign 10 year contracts DOE is interested says Tino because of the redundant dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability and because Dennis and Tino pitched DOE on all the DOE will make from the surplus power sales Dennis apparently pitched them a share the upside deal under which DOE keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales Tino showed DOE the July spot prices at 4 Corners which Tino said included many days over 200 Mwh and they got all excited DOE has done a similar share the upside deal at one of its facilities in Calif Tino says and they have occasionally come out net positive on elec costs in some months so they like the approach Tino had two questions 1 Does TW have 30 40 000 d of permian capacity available starting sometime in 2001 or

If there is incidental ethane extracted in conjunction with propane NNG will be reimbursed with the propane 2 In regard to point on netting months NNG does not agree with sentence one ok with second sentence 3 In regard to point on netting products NNG does not agree with this This was not the intent nor the practice until KN commenced and is the issue being discussed in regard to the audit of the Stranger s Gas reimbursement Per the bid package Northern is requesting reimbursement by product but does realize that it may receive zero for certain products after reimbursement has occurred for others 4 In regard to point on reimbursement of Btu s NNG on behalf of its customers must be kept whole for the volumes The amount related to the Stranger s gas contract needs to be kept whole We are not resolving not addressing the measurement issue in the discussion of the Stranger s gas contract 5 The contract to be utilized is the pro forma included in the Bid package however Oneok is free to mark up with proposed changes to be specficially discussed All parties that participated in the bid process have utilized this contract not the existing one The mark up is not to be a wholesale delete with the old contract language inserted 6 In the event we are unable to reach agreement on the Stranger s Gas contract NNG requests in writing an assurance of how Oneok is going to modify its facilities etc to assure that it will not unlawfully take liquids that belong to others 7 Agreed to meet in Omaha on Sept 6th starting at 9 00 am ","sent_time":"2000-08-11

Northern You ll recall that Steve s chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate customer imbalances by month Proving once again that TW is just a little different that method shows no correlation at all on TW I agree with Vig s conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a correlation Steve s method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities that occur early and late in a month Please tell me if you agree marketing folks but I think a more logical approach would risk weight the apparent arb opportunites In other words an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell the gas for a 25 mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index will be at the end of the month In contrast an opportunity to make 25 on the 25th of a month when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the monthly index will be is basically free money Using that logic I ignored any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month I eyeballed the timing and size of the arb opportunites i e there s a 70 90 arb opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May 2000 rather than using Steve s mathematical approach I still didn t see the kind of correlation I d expect The correlation is directionally positive in only 4 out of 12 months and the size of the imbalances doesn t even make sense in the months that correlate on direction I give up and am removing the arb argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft I ll route that separately Thanks to Vig Susan Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis Its

segmenting section I think it is a fine legal argument but it lacks something What is our or else position Does the Global Settlement give us any FERC out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue I m not suggesting that we should trigger a FERC out if we have one but if we arguably do we should consider threatening to use it I m afraid we come across as whiny and FERC s position will likely be so what what are you going to do about it If we have no arguable FERC out and the only or else we have is that we ll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal I m for leaving the draft as is We can make our appeal threat more direct on rehearing if they hose us in the initial order 2 On the arbitrage argument I ve taken out any reference to an example and softened the verbiage a bit I want to leave in the references to the arbitrage issue however because FERC understands the problem and believes it is widespread We don t need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on our system although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts 3 Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement If so we d better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting section Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won t play well It is my understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback resolution deal so I hope this won t be a problem 4 On FN 20 I d suggest we use Vig s data and chart for May of 2000 The arb opportunity is huge and clear We reference in the FN that we use all six of the Gas Daily price points and I think Vig used just 3 What s the right answer Good work

power cost after rebate comes pretty close to zero Even using a more reasonable sampling of Four Corners prices the DOE price is apparently better than their current PNM price The big issue is whether DOE can figure out how to keep the rebate at Sandia rather than lose the to treasury Sounds like the Dennis and Tino show is still flogging this deal pretty hard so I reminded Tino that we are eager

Capacity Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border Topock AZ prices in the last month have risen by 2 50 MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border T here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse collusion and affiliate self dealing of out of state gas suppliers and merchants Edison told the CPUC The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out of state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity It notes the complaint conservatively estimates that the anti competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by 100 million annually since the beginning of 1998 Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 4 5133 MMBtu which was applied to SCE s August 2000 avoided cost posting to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of October and every month going forward It estimated September bidweek border prices would average 7 MMBtu If such prices were used in Edison s September avoided costs posting its Transition Formula payments to certain independent power producers will be 29 million more than the month prior the company told the CPUC No mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time ","sent_time":"2000-09-05

nasty one It might be good for Steve H or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high level courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we ll work with them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah At minimum we ll probably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing I see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on 1 The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days FERC really punted this issue They say that since the expansion capacity is fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly disclose the agreements This is the first time I ve heard of any rule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right to confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info At minimum we could argue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn t even mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of discount reports It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an applicant to file its rate information with the Commission which we did and ignores the regulation Sec 284 7 c 6 that doesn t require a pipeline to publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days after the close of the billing period to which the discount pertained The commercial people need to decide if we care about this issue i e how upset will the customers with the high rates be when they learn about the low rates Also Frank and Steve and Susan since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue do we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing 2 The ECS issue I think we can work around this for the Gallup project by filing a report describing the operational control TW has under the O M agreement I ve talked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will get back to me today My real worry is what the operational control requirement does to our future outsourcing monetization projects I think ECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other deals i e TW compressor monetization in order for both of us to get the accounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams If we agree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal FERC will use it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal Arthur Anderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal which is after all the whole point of doing it if TW retains too much control over the asset I m not sure how to solve this yet but lets all put some thought into it 3 Any others I ll turf

Hardee CHardee WRF com Subject MHP Bath 2d Cir Argument We argued the Bath appeal in the Second Circuit last Friday Bath s counsel went first for 10 minutes I was second for 8 minutes Alan Knauf was next for CREST for 2 minutes David Connors took 2 minutes for TPC and Bath s counsel took the final 2 minutes for rebuttal The panel took the matter under advisement when the argument was finished The panel was Judge Jacobs who was on the recent Primetime 24 Joint Venture case dealing with the access barring sham exception to Noerr Pennington Judge Straub and Judge Sacks All three are from private practice with large firms The argument went reasonably well although the panel played it pretty close to the vest Bath s counsel was not brilliant and received a lot of hard questions from the bench The panel seemed to have no trouble with the fact that the District Court reviewed the administrative record in addition to the allegations in Bath s complaint They got close to getting a concession from Bath s counsel that the complaint alleges damages from long delays in the administrative process which necessarily puts at issue the overall course of the agency proceedings and requires the judge to review the record The panel also seemed uninterested in Bath s argument that Noerr Pennington immunity only applies to antitrust cases The panel recognized that the First Amendment protections must apply to all types of causes of action The biggest issue for the panel appeared to be the fraud sham exception to Noerr Pennington During argument Bath s counsel suggested that if only he had discovery he would be able to prove that MHP s experts had doctored the geological data as part of submitting their fraudulent affidavits I countered that this was the first we had ever heard of such allegations that they were never part of Bath s complaint and that the only allegation was that the expert s opinions were wrong and without basis The court came back to the question of what to do if a party claims that there has been clear fraud committed during the agency proceeding I argued and Judge Straub agreed that such fraud is only relevant under the case law if it goes to the very core of the proceeding and deprives it of its legitimacy The district court s opinion establishes that noting like that occurred here Finally both I and David Connors argued that the lower court s alternative proximate cause ruling was independently fatal to Bath s complaint in that the alleged fraud even if it had occurred did not cause any of Bath s alleged damages Please call me 202

Technically you are right and PNM s service is neither firm or interruptible It is my understanding that PNM assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the customer is a core customer or not et cet I think that PNM is capable of determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be firm even though the rate schedule may not say firm Explaining all that complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing Nevertheless I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is firm I think the draft does that without going throught the unhelpful detail on how PNM handles its own priority system If I misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with

Call","recipient_count":"7","email_attachment":null,"message_body":"MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline probably today to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem i e the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement If Midam does so Enforcement will then contact Northern for a response probably Dari or MKM or I but who knows who they ll call If they do the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to MidAm 1 Midam and all of our customers are aware that a Commission order on the June 2 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this Nov March period can be determined The flow obligation for sourcers like MidAm will be slightly higher by about 3 if the settlement is approved For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios settlement approval or settlement non approval we have given that information We gave that information to MidAm also We can t file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement 2 The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is minimal We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement MidAm may have done that but we don t know If not and if the Commission approves the Settlement their only real cost would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume about 1100 MMBtu d for MidAm now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply Given the large drop in gas prices the last several days there may not be any increased cost 3 The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement The majority of Northern s customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton problem MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall That s the end of the proposed script The last bullet may go to far but I like it Frank and Steve MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak and others to call FERC hotline or otherwise I don t think it matters and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda DF

Fossum ET S Enron ENRON cc Susan Scott ET S Enron ENRON Subject Price Gouging Drew I will try to summarize the research I did today on the referenced subject The bottom line is that I did not find any California statutes that appeare to be applicable to what we re doing I looked at California s General Business Regulations Unfair Trade Practices statute the Public Utilities Code an ALR annotation that discussed cases in which courts have reviewed acts or practices prohibited by state deceptive trade practice and consumer protection statutes and I searched case law and statutes using terms such as gouging unconscionable pricing practices etc The California Unfair Practices Act is not a price fixing statute but seeks to regulate conduct of those engaged in business in order to eliminate such unfair practices as price discrimination indulged in for purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition It does not make every difference in price unlawful but only those differences that cannot be justified after proper allowance has been made for differences in grade quality quantity or cost of transportation It appears that the statutes and cases that are anywhere close to what we re looking for deal with protection of the ultimate consumer and not sophisticated energy companies I did find a price gouging statute in New York that states that its purpose is to prohibit conduct that could occur during periods of abnormal disruption of the market caused by strikes power failures severe shortages or other extraordinary adverse circumstances when parties have taken unfair advangage of consumers by charging grossly excessive prices for essential goods and services I reviewed two cases People v Two Wheel Corp and State of New York v Strong Oil Company that deal with a company that sold portable electric generators at unconscionably excessive prices during a power failure caused by a hurricane and a company that sold home heating fuel at an unconscionably excessive price during a period of abnormal disruption of the market respectively The Strong Oil case discussed Federal pre emption of state law due to the Federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act I will put copies of these cases as well as some of the other documents mentioned above in your in box in case you want to review them I looked briefly at Texas law but didn t see anything I obviously didn t get

Fuel","recipient_count":"4","email_attachment":null,"message_body":"This morning I raised a concern regarding TW s sale of excess fuel at downstream points Here s the problem the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points With rare exceptions those receipt points are not at the Cal border Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point x it should resell the gas at point x and not haul the gas to point y and then sell it there as a delivered i e bundled product My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement because the Cal border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location or the furthest upstream point requirement or both Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at a point other than Permian pool we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it I haven t confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn t just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it we needed someone to pay us to transport it Irrespective of what we did with ECS I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation We receive fuel at the shippers receipt points Once we receive it however it is no longer fuel It becomes line pack until it is burned Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons including shipper imbalances etc It also obviously has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel It is our job to manage line pack and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short and sell it at locations where we are long If we end up long at the Cal border from time to time we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels I wouldn t want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal border but thats not what we are talking about here I can t think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this

Subject Citizens request for proposal Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its non telecommunications businesses throughout North America One of their principal assets Louisiana Gas Service LGS is one of those companies recently sold by Citizens LGS provided gas control and operations services to other non LGS companies including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in Arizona With the consummation of the sale of LGS Citizens has told me confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the interconnect metering and 1 5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power Plant Therefore Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide contract operations services under an operating agreement TW has been asked in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these facilities Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for Citizens In a related legal regulatory question does TW have the authority to conduct contract services on behalf of others or would we have to perform these services as a separate legal entity If we do does this present an affiliate problem for us if we share operating employees If these threshold questions can be accommodated and TW is not only able to provide contract operations services for Citizens but has a commercial desire to do so what would we charge Citizens for this service Although it would appear at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities remember that Citizens will be receiving gas potentially from both TW and EPNG simultaneously presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure between the pipes but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts from both pipes as well as the plant site Although I m the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards transportation matters I m certainly willing to step out of the middle of this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves I will be happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1 2 page letter Citizens sent to me on the 17th soliciting TW s interest Given the

637 filing The gist of PNM s protest in RP00 626 is that we shouldn t be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard What exactly do we mean by no additional cost unless through the allocation process quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel Can someone help me with this Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway I would say we probably wouldn t mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright However it s more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language Or they could tell us to remove the subject to transportation and fuel provision If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer However I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it so I can justify it to FERC Any comments you have in

James Saunders FGT Enron Enron Dan Fancler ET S Enron Enron Harry Walters ET S Enron Enron Subject Re Quarterly Noteholder Reports Thanks for your comments below We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures It wasn t a big deal for Enron s 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in the consolidated statements As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers there are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a stand alone basis Since most of these positions will be gone by year end it won t look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter In fact if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions in time we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and we wouldn t have had all these gross positions I don t feel quite as bad about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I otherwise would since we did review the transactions and the noteholders disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the noteholders reports were distributed As always Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures

Miller ET S Enron ENRON Subject Quarterly Noteholder Reports I ve reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders I haven t had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings but I have three questions concerns First the discussions of Price Risk Management Activities seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial impact of the deals involved For example we disclose the total notional amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal the fair value of the trades and a variety of other details even the total economic impact of the deal to us is pretty small about a million dollars if I remember right The base gas deal by comparison was discussed in one sentence Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing something more meaningful like VAR which I assume would be a much smaller number Second disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was since the TW and NN portions offset one another I know we need to disclose deals separately for each operating company but is there a way things like notional value and fair value or VAR can be aggregated to more accurately reflect the total impact of the deal currently it looks like both TW and NN were out doing huge commodity deals Third I have never been that concerned about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the limited distribution However if these disclosures will be Arthur Anderson s template for the Enron Corp 10Q or the FERC Form 2s I have a real problem Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues DF ","sent_time":"2000-12-11 03:55:00-08:00","message_folder":"sent","received_time":"2000-12-11

ENA transaction For the most part the order is a good one It observes that ENA holds little capacity on TW and that PG E and Socal control a larger portion of capacity on TW With respect to policy matters the order is good in the sense that it reaffirms that a pipeline can withhold capacity to maximize the value of services if shippers are not willing to pay maximum rates My only concern with the order appears in the last paragraph before Section C Here the Commission cautions that its will address on an expedited basis future allegations that TW is not allocating capacity on a non discriminatory basis Certainly the Commission has always had this authority anyway Nonetheless I am a little bit troubled that the Commission is addressing Transwestern at all in an El Paso order TW shouldn t have to read the orders of other pipelines for any directives that apply to it My knee jerk reaction is that we would want clarification that the Commission is just reiterating its general willingness to take up any bona fide complaints and is not imposing any directive on TW But I m guessing you ll probably say we should just let that sentence pass in an otherwise good order that does

law gave them The subject to agreement by Transwestern language is redundant since the previous clause says by mutual written agreement Additionally its confusing and innacurate because the provided however that clause isn t even binding if we mutually agree to eliminate it I therefore think we ought to take par 4 out or at least remove the provided however clause I don t agree that we can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release We can mutually agree to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap release I suppose we would need to use cap release if the termination or reduction of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another shipper however I would propose one change to Par 3 just to make the discount more clear The par talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary receipts I d add this after the words Appendix A at the end of the current first sentence and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A The discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in Transwestern s East of Thoreau EOT area I m a fan of being extremely clear when we limit

Approval Request The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures However the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything doesn t give NMNG any rights since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement and it s subject to available capacity Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff I think I would recommend we omit it However NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the deal or at least the conversations of the parties If that s the case I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to

signed off on a right of way agreement that they simply should not have and in my opinion is outside their area of expertise and practice I am going to follow up with the individual on this and it also appears that they were at least in part a victim of a calculated snow job by our brethern over at Enron Northern America as well as a misunderstanding of the marketing affilate rule Along these lines I am concerned that some of our folks in an effort to be responsive to our clients may feel that they have to provide advice in areas where they should be seeking the advice of those who practice in that area on a routine basis I think it would be helpful for the three of us to establish guidelines for our folks on when we would expect them to seek guidance from others who practice in certain primary areas of responsibility For example if an environmental question comes up I would expect any lawyer in our group to talk to Mr Reich or myself If an issue arose with respect to Northern s tariff one would expect that the lawyer would speak to Maria Drew or Dari Let me know what you think and we will go from there Lou ","sent_time":"2000-02-01

his team on February 10 Also participating in the outreach meeting will be Williams Judy Neason Scott Turkington El Paso Peggy Heeg and Coastal Dan Collins The meeting comes at Larcamp s request and is part of a series of outreach meetings that OMTR is having with other industry groups including producers gas and electric utilities and marketers The purpose of the meeting is not to discuss positions in the current gas NOPR as OMTR is assuming that the Commission will take action on the gas NOPR in February The purpose of the meeting is discuss how markets are changing and talk about upcoming regulatory issues There will be no formal presentations or slides Lorraine will give a 5 minute overview on INGAA s themes on regulatory policy these theme s are per the Board of Directors Task Force on FERC Policy Competition Re contracting challenges Rate discounting Each of the four participating companies will have 5 minutes to relate their pipeline experiences to these themes I would propose to focus my remarks on topic of the continuous contracting state of the pipeline capacity market The point is to tell Larcamp that we are not looking for a regulatory answer to this short term continuous contracting environment What we are seeking is the rate and service flexibility we need to meet these challenges Examples will be the new services flexibility that we continue to seek on TW Enhanced Firm Backhaul Limited Firm And the pricing changes we seek on NNG including seasonal rates Again I don t plan to have any formal slides but here is the outline of the message I would also propose to add some specific examples data on capacity release recent auction experiences and re contracting statistics FYI El Paso plans to talk about the role that negotiated rate transactions will increasingly play in the market place citing their experiences in placing El Paso capacity and their negotiated rate contract extensions on Tenn E Tenn Williams tentatively plans to talk about additional flexibility on offshore pipelines about the need for more self implementing flexibility and the impacts of regulatory delay Please let me know by Monday February 7 is you have

of fuel If we are to only move the 850 MMcf d the changing of horsepower may not be needed I have a call into Ron Matthews for the answer The reason we are asking this question is save capital dollars

before contracting for transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines The new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to FERC first The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still prohibited and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity Interestingly the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant to its capacity release program The order is silent on whether the price cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity While we are still reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at a later time I d emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts For example the Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures dated Feb 3 2000 provides Dave and
