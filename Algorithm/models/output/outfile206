thought it best that I address my questions to you directly Here is my situation I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th I expect to realize a gain of around 400 000 See calculations below Sales price 2 100 000 Purchase price 1 200 000 Fees Devel costs 500 000 Profit 400 000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to 1 million after repayment of a loan I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify First there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner Ltd for 1 15 million six months ago I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project We could not come to terms for the development so the partnership was conveyed to me The loan still exist I am an 80 limited partner Another investor is the other limited partner We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner We intend to develop the property Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange Second I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for 400 000 I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP If neither of these deals qualify I would still like to find another piece of property My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different

target for Sumas value is AECO 0 10 But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0 70 or wider versus a rest of

like Keith Here is the article Sector 2 plan geets boost from council By MURLIN EVANS Staff Reporter H ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu re land use plan to consult for development in the area The San Marcos Ci ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan changes over a year in the making and covering a 1 26 squa re mile area intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a nd appropriate for the region Significant to the revisions are those affe cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue Bishop Street We atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari ous city commissions declining to approve re zoning plans the landowner say s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan Proposed changes to Weatherford s 54 acre tract which have no dir ect effect on existing zoning deletes the 10 acres of high density resid ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial one additional acre of medium density residential and seven a dditional acres of low density residential In addition the total eight a cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su ggested limited to town home single family or multi family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan The total 10 acres of co mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to community commerci al a yet to be established zoning district loosely defined as to ens ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit h buffering and landscaping A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan However a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po se on the busy state highway Proposed are two curb cuts one accessing th e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave nue While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford Council member Jane Hughso n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect or Plan but evaluating a developer s plans for possibly locating one in th e area as development proceeds I d rather say no and if someone comes us with a really good idea look at it then Hughson said Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th e curb cut It seems to me we re asking for a bunch of accidents to happe n there Mihalkanin said A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3 3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting Curb cuts or not the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa l residents and neighborhood representatives who said the plan was a good compromise Oak Heights resident John McBride who has been an active crit ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process especially concernin g the Weatherford tract said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole This is not a victory for one side or the other said McBride alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford s initial plans for his property but a victory for the City of San Marcos We started out with all R 1 we ve come a long way 09 20

the SIP s with 8 5 roof panels and use a metal roof I have been working with Johnnie Brown a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep The problem is that I have a budget of 85 90 sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget I don t want to settle for a conventional stick built house I was wondering about alternatives Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP s For example I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec He will spray foam insulation at 1 30 sf That would be approximately 10 000 compared to over 20 000 additional costs for the panels But would the foam insulation be as effective Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors

plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305 000 But there is not a professional management company Subtracting 25 000 for management costs the NOI would be 280 000 However I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to 3 000 unit This would yield an NOI of 240 000 Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties it doesn t look like the rents have a great deal of upside The asking price is 2 700 000 Using 240 000 would make this an 8 9 cap Using the seller s NOI of 280 000 would be a 10 4 cap The cost per unit is 33 750 for a 1969 project The cost per square foot is 36 58 The numbers would be better if the property was offered at 2 5 million Jeff Smith claims that 2 7 million is as low as the seller will go This property has not been on the market So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it If 280 000 is a reasonable NOI then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for 2 7 million It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants Plus the location is by far the most convenient Financing is the other consideration I am assuming 25 year 7 and 25 down What

possible to move the addition f orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game play music room Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost Part of the play room that is bord ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers This way you would not have to add a second staircase The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed room should be minor construction In the back you could slope the roof un til you were within the setback Then you could place a large dormer facin g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition The kitche n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b e

Managing VAR limits is essential and P L Penalties are a great way to achieve this However we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as 1 discouraging aggressive trading and 2 significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime I still disagree with the 1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit The punishment does not fit the crime What message are you trying to send The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times Also locations such as Socal Malin and PG E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes I know these are not your intended messages I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches 500 000 and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than 500 000 The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation Please consider these suggestions We want to play by the rules but the rules need to be fair and known in advance Also we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the 1 million from this morning Phillip
