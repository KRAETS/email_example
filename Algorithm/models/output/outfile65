The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority 2 The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff Beth is moving from Sun O S to Sun Sularis which should allow us to address the problem We have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks Once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems 3 The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the traders to meet their needs Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads After this Beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs 4 The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis This is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff Beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working 5 Steve Natt is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin Presto s approval that addresses our needs with respect to all requirements deals and volume management deals in the east 6 There will be no more business trips to London somewhat kidding 7 Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with Houston John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in Portland Since Tim was not in the meeting John will make sure we are covering all his needs ","message_folder":"sent","message_mailbox":"lavorato-j","message_subject":"N.A.

back I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation We went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada It was absolutely awesome I had the time of my life We built the business with very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp s bottom line These days as many people know we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth pulp and paper coal and many others So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businesses What a lot of people don t realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power The opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there These businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina You can t put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities Its not like trading bonds where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do It has much more complexity and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it get down here we need you John s callout quote Enron s not a place where you can hide If you can t get it done you won t fit in But if you can and you work hard

VAR that the Board allocated to Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following 1 5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES s positions from the Wholesale gas and power groups This has already been done 2 Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the trading heads of North America Lavorato and Europe Sherriff 3 With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the Cross Commodity Trading Group which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and use it as it sees fit I will run this group and currently be the only employee This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we need to throw more VAR at certain positions I see the individual trading groups staying within their VAR limits However I do see the need for a true cross
