Mayor mayorkatz ci portland or us cc Subject e Katz Chief Kroeker Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens about their opinions on Chief Kroeker About an hour ago I held a news conference to release the statement below in response I wanted to make sure you were able to read it in its entirety You are a part of my e Katz list because of your work with me or my administration To be removed from the e Katz distribution list simply reply to this e mail with your request If you have multiple e mail addresses you use please include a name and or company otherwise we may not be able to locate the correct entry to remove For more information on the Katz administration visit our website at http www ci portland or us mayor Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously I have reviewed this situation with care I want to thank those who provided me feedback either in person over the telephone or through e mail The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests with me I want to apologize for the concern pain and fear caused by the taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker His taped comments in no way reflect my own personal beliefs My community and staff discussions along with reading all the e mails and transcripts of all my telephone messages helped distill my thinking on this issue to one key question Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious views from his professional conduct I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue to do so His performance has met my expectations He is leading the bureau in a fair respectful and inclusive manner He is moving our law enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing Therefore I have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police He has my strong support to continue The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal religious views I have a responsibility to review their employment status if their actions as a result of their personal views impair their ability to perform their professional responsibilities Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he is out of step with Portland could be used in other Oregon communities to fire more liberal public officials who are out of step with their community s conservative majority My 30 year fight for tolerance goes both ways Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens He assures me he is prepared to do so He told me he would rather help undo the damage help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people than just walk away He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who are gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered including those on his staff He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a gay disease He will continue to seek advice from the City Council the Bureau s Sexual Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts He agrees to take all this on with all his heart In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience I will work to turn this negative situation into a positive one to expand our sense of tolerance to promote the notion that regardless of a person s personal or religious beliefs one can be an effective public servant and to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders As Mayor I will do my part and more I hope you will join

Environmental issue like Global warming Excessive use of natural resources Recycling Pollution is of major significance The impact on the business is becoming to increase 2 The Kyoto Conference COP3 defined an international framework for dealing with the issue of global warming The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6 for Japan 7 for the U S A 8 for the EU Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism Kyoto Mechanism for International Emissions Trading IET Joint Implement JI and Clean Development Mechanism CDM will be decided on at COP6 which is scheduled for November 2000 GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying 2 GHG Reduction 1 The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change remains uncertain at present and further research is required Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains flexibility 2 Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures economic measures and voluntary measures Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business competition 3 Energy Conservation 1 The U S A is the largest consumer of energy In such a large mobile country much consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector 2 The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy 3 Japan has very limited natural resources and energy conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s As a result Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP Japan s policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental plans and other measures Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at their factories 4 Programme of Industry 1 Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing cost saving in the long run See attached file

at IEA ministerial Dear Rosalee I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 Sustainable Development and the New Economy As discussed he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM his is titled Fuelling Sustainable Development On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI speaking on hydrocarbon issues Mr Luis Echavarri the head of the OECD s Nuclear Energy Agency speaking on nuclear power and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment Svend Auken speaking on renewables and energy efficiency The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit des Sciences et de l Industrie in La Villete in northern Paris As I believe I noted in our previous e mail communications while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note see below It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs including a biography and photo as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make I

phone call each of you received on Friday checking availability for dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday April 6th BACKGROUND During the last week of February BCCA and Partnership leaders met separately with Congressman DeLay Congressman Joe Barton and with two top staff members of Mr DeLay in order to update them on our extensive activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance Pursuant to those meetings Mr DeLay s office has asked for some follow up meetings to be held in Houston on Friday April 6th He intends to travel to this area on that day along with and as host to Congressman Barton R Texas Chairman of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and with Congressman Billy Tauzin R Louisiana Chairman House Committee on Energy and Commerce The Energy and Commerce Committee has oversight over Clean Air Act matters DeLay has requested support from and interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY After time spent early in the day in Mr DeLay s congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local officials Mr DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship channel tour and presentations on SIP status science and modeling issues We are working closely with Mr DeLay s staff on all these matters He has asked to end the day with a small dinner with CEOs to have a frank discussion about our clean air issues This is the dinner my staff called your office about on Friday Clearly Mr DeLay is interested in what he and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP He has asked that we also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner which we are doing Mr DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance This will obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor Everyone in attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in advance There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance RSVPs TO DATE Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller Ed Galante Jim Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner Charles Duncan and Kelly Frels are checking calendars Ken Lay Steve Letbetter and Dan Smith are unavailable We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to attend the dinner My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St Regis and to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a board member s home nearby I trust

Walker missouri edu on 08 28 2000 04 17 56 PM To kenneth lay enron com kenneth lay enron com cc rosalee fleming enron com rosalee fleming enron com Subject P Walker professorship and keynote request Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the professorship honoring Pinkney Walker I m delighted that you plan to attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13 The purpose of this e mail which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient way of reaching you is two fold 1 To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney C Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship Rather than designating the professorship for Business and Economics for Business Theory or for some other area I d like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach I have a call into Harold Hook to seek his input A few points of elaboration Distinguished is a standard adjective in the titles of such positions We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the college to select the recipient of the professorship subject to my approval And I don t know if we will have the recipient selected by October 13 This name for the professorship 1 coincides with Pinkney s great strength 2 allows me to avoid any turf battles either within the college or with Economics and 3 underscores the great importance of teaching in the college Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name 2 To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society banquet on October 13 We would be honored if you would present a brief talk perhaps 10 minutes in length related to some aspect of the future of business Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive event By way of brief background Jack and Mary Bush MU alumni who now live in Dallas and are co chairs of the Davenport Society this year have chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed probably followed by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the morning of October 13 perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable for the Davenport Society banquet Of course you have great latitude in choosing the topic you would like to address Please let me know if you will serve as the keynote speaker If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests we will complete the plans for the evening which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship and I hope a keynote address by you Naturally if you have questions either you or Rosalee can call me My office is 573 882 6688 and my home is 573 875 2972 Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13 Apparently he had has been experiencing some health problems However the latest I ve heard is that he intends to attend due in large part to your commitment to be there Time permitting you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you ll see him here in Columbia on October 13 By the way if Pinkney and his wife arrive on October 12 I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I will host that evening for members of the college s advisory board Of course you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well but it s my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13 Ken thanks very much I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of R R during your vacation I look forward to hearing from you

keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon on Wednesday April 25 to help set the tone goals and objectives for this event Our theme is 2001 An Energy Odyssey We are using the conference to showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy and to deal with issues that impede or facilitate market development as well as enterprise strategy and metamorphosis We can think of no one better to clearly define these major themes and priorities than you I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in Montreal last May and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote and hope that the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t o heart The thoughts you offered on the importance of standards the opportunities to build network platforms and Enron s own experience are of vital importance to IAEE USAEE members We would ask you to include comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in markets on behalf of enterprises The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry business an d university interests engaged in energy development and policy To bring yo u up to date on the association our Web site is www iaee org I m sure Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together for you I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc e at the end of this mail which lines out the major sessions and topics In addition to our invitation to you we are inviting Mark Moody Stuart of RD Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues and Rilwanu Lukman Secretary General of OPEC and a member of IAEE in a joint session with the Board of Directors of the

Ken Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the Enron Teaching Excellence Awards It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person Ironically when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such If the alumni see that you support our efforts they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work Please provide me any feedback you may have As we talked about today we would like to begin having occasional brown bags in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university I believe that we should have one with Dr Smith to promote the image campaign changes at the university the tier 1 status etc If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well I will send you the date when I have it Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game We will have a tent food refreshments football tickets etc I suspect that it will be from approx 4 00 PM to 10 00 PM Please let me know if your calendar is free I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free we would love to have you Thank you for

especially after he sees your message Rosie Rebecca McDonald ENRON DEVELOPMENT 02 29 2000 11 51 AM To Kenneth Lay ENRON cc Subject Ghana Ken I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana You might remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing from the Ghanaian Ambassador Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate a meeting between you and Chevron We have been working Ghana pretty hard including the West African Gas Pipeline the Effasu Power Project a marketing company and a host of other possibilities We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right now in Nigeria the loss of projects in Cote d Ivoire due to the coup d etat and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana that we are slowing down a bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on additional ones Clearly this is a bit of a cop out I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we are slowing down generally in Africa because I don t want to hurt the barge deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique and there is truth to the Cote d Ivoire and Nigeria issues And of course I don t want to alienate Ghana generally I have a good relationship with the Ambassador from Ghana in fact I just got a postcard from him two days ago and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me I will deliver this message hopefully diverting the call to you If he does get to you first he won t be upset for you to send him on to me I don t believe If there is any clarification please give me a holler I hope the

items of the MC Hello John I hope you have returned to normal after the MC I can only say that it was a tremendous success and everyone should be congratulated that worked on the planning Now to the final items We are billing everyone for the hotel golf and regatta this week and we have a few questions The hotel and golf are easy However the regatta is a different situation When we started this project the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished We quoted 85 00 per person however the Millennium rate was actually 100 00 per person This would not be such a great problem however we had 33 no shows for the regatta This being said we have two choices We bill those that sailed for an additional 15 00 to make their charge 100 00 which then leaves us with a negative 3500 00 Or we also bill the 33 no shows for 100 00 each which puts us pretty close to break even In the big picture there have been some budget cost that were less than expected and some that were more We will have the final budget complete by the end of next week The most important issue is it acceptable to bill those that sailed 100 00 or do you want us to stay at the original price of 85 00 Then of course what should we do about the no shows Possibly bill them a cancellation fee or the full fee Or forget and forgive this time I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow however my trusted partner Janelle will be here until the 20th of January We would like to get everything finalized before she leaves Give us your thoughts The EX MC Director Sharon

filed by a Plaintiff who is represented by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action lawsuit i e the Nike situation The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a shareholder derivative lawsuit What this means is that the plaintiff shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on behalf of i2 The claim is based on the Nike facts but the Plaintiff is claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions What is interesting is that all damages recovered would go to i2 So why the lawsuit The Plaintiff can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings as a sort of tag along type of action The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit on your behalf Normally I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm try and track you down but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate time i e client meeting during a speech Please let me know if you would like for us to accept service on your behalf This is very common practice I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit Needless to say you are indemnified for this i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you and i2 does have insurance to

Subject Final Draft SEC Report on Valuation Attached please find the final draft Tim Koller and I hope it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call Of course we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail but I think we came as close as we will get There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do and we are working on that even as we send this off To the best of my knowledge there may now be two individual views to go into what is now Attachment D Len Baker may feel that the language on Safe Harbor doesn t go far enough Baruch Lev feels that the SEC should not only issue a concept release to solicit broad public comments on a supplementary framework for reporting intangibles but it should create a task force to do the work Most of the group feels this approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change Baruch also feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure we are exaggerating what companies will in fact disclose My suggestion Len and Baruch is to write a paragraph or two for Attachment D if you wish Hopefully both of you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general but if you feel strongly that the report doesn t reflect all your views please do state them for the record Before we schedule a final call for last minute details etc I d like to request an e mail fax or phone call from each of you letting me know if you can sign off on the report I d appreciate this by Monday April 16th Thanks a million Best regards Jeff SEC Task Force Draft 04092001 doc SEC Press Release 4 06 01 doc SEC Task Force

me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help with her garden project I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this we should say a polite no The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O Neill Managing Director of Lurgi Invent Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really is difficult to justify any Wessex help Lurgi Invent has done a little work for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden However this business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent Given the nature of the project the approach from the Duchess and the fact that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself we really do believe no is the right answer Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to correspond direct with the Duchess Best wishes Colin

Enron","sender_address":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","message_mailbox":"lay-k","message_body":"It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday Based on our conversatio n 20 this email includes the following An Enron contact to discuss developing small scale generation on Tribal lan ds Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow 20 to remove those impediments A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR 01 s ability to 20 sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two 20 possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1 a California PUC 20 order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through 20 rates and 2 an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal I 20 have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d 20 amendments to AB1X We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable 20 option Our assessment of the supply demand picture in California Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near 20 and long term electricity crisis in California We will deliver to your 20 office today detailed legislative language In those materials we will als o 20 identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed 20 language I hope that the information is useful Please do not hesitate to contact m e 20 if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anythi ng 20 else that I can do to assist you Regards Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American

7851 2 Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand by Charges Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a 20 step in the right direction Utility stand by charges have always been 20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract 20 monopoly prices from customers or both But there is no reason to limit t he 20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 20 1MW These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for 20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e 20 the risk of black outs this summer We would propose lifting the cap by 20 offering amendments to SB27X which is designed to facilitate development o f 20 distributed generation 20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with 20 investor owned and municipal utilities Solution The Governor 01 s executive order regarding interconnection is a 20 step in the right direction 01 D D 26 01 requires utilities to complete 20 interconnection studies within 7 days California should ensure that this 20 requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed 20 generation In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when 20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome 20 through executive orders or other regulations To the greatest extent 20 possible California should shift control over interconnection away from th e 20 utility and place that control with the California ISO This could be 20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed i e 01 on site 018 generation that is 50 MWs or 20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an d 20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large scale 20 generation faces 20 Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D 22 01 thru 20 D 26 01 issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant 20 output apply equally to smaller scale 01 distributed generation 018 facil ities 20 In addition distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to 20 face local opposition The State should ensure that local parochial 20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects 20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X 3 Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase 20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities 20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with 20 suppliers Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th e 20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible However ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk 20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms We understand that the lion 01 s share of counterparties share Enron 01 s c redit 20 risk concerns Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements 20 going forward Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to 20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power From our 20 analysis of the bill the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the 20 California PUC 01 s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California As 20 such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat es 20 adequate charges to cover DWR 01 s costs of power purchases Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract 01 Prudence 018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public 20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are 20 01 imprudent 018 On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then ref use to 20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power 20 purchases Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee 20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that 20 DWR has entered into with suppliers 20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to 20 Recover DWR 01 s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority 20 noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to 20 the specific ratemaking 01 mechanics 018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl oy to 20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it i s 20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu re 20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs Moreover as currently drafted it is 20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in 20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR 01 s power purchase 20 costs Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since 20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover 20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk 20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri sk 20 issues We have identified three options Amend AB1X The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the 20 PUC would accept as 01 prudent and reasonable 018 all purchase costs incur red by 20 DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to 20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases This is the 20 preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political 20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X See attached file 20 entitled 01 AmendAB1X doc 018 Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC and 20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to 20 implement However it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re 20 time to implement than the legislative fix We have attached electronic 20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC 20 would need to issue under this option See attached file entitled 20 01 cpuctalkingpoints doc 018 Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR 01 s RFP we are willing to ac cept 20 other forms of credit from DWR Those options include a letter of credit 20 cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral DWR officials have 20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR 20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through 20 contract amendments 4 California 01 s Supply demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research 20 Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports 20 showing that California faces a severe supply demand imbalance They diffe r 20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available Al l 20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer 20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are 20 likely 20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this 20 summer by approximately 5 000 MW These numbers are in line with our 20 estimates California 01 s supply base currently has a 6 capacity margin well 20 below the average 15 20 which is recommended for reliable system operatio n 20 in the West Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power 20 than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the 20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t o 20 date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he 20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply 20 California 01 s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this 20 requirement 20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early 20 draw down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California s seve re 20 supply demand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced 20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the 20 utilities Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t 20 pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be 20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of 20 rolling black outs this summer The CEC paints a considerably more 20 optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional 5 000 20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand It is our view that California 20 should view the CEC s rosy scenario with considerable skepticism 5 Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California 01 s 20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution We wil l 20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing 20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to California s 20 crisis must focus on four issues Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California 01 s Investor owned utilities to solvency Increase supply Legislative vehicle SB28X Sher To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years 20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less 20 than a year In California it takes about six years or longer The Governor 01 s executive orders and Senator Sher 01 s siting reform legi slation 20 are steps in the right direction Our suggested amendments can improve tho se 20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face 20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit 20 requirements included in the CEC s certification requirements Enron 01 s 20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1 obtaining credits and 2 20 transfering credits between air districts In addition it creates an 20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund 20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir 20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the 20 required reductions in pollution emissions Decrease demand 01 Legislative Vehicle AB31X Wright Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing 20 the supply demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the 20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer This can be accomplished mo st 20 effectively and quickly in two ways Buy down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun d 20 to finance DWR 01 s power purchases California could likely reduce demand more 20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld 20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period e g 20 through the summer months DWR could easily run an on line auction to 20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions To 20 participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment 20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the 20 reductions Enron has developed an on line auction software package 01 D eal 20 Bench 018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful customers need access to the following key elements An internet based hour ahead price posting system to track the market price 20 for hour ahead power in real time 20 Real time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment 20 verification Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be 20 paid for load reduction 01 Negawatts 018 The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e 01 creation 018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California parti cularly 20 in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation 20 resources reduction of peak or super peak load on the over stressed California 20 electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in 20 the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k 20 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to 20 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for 20 responding 20 We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on peak demand response in 20 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for 20 summer 2002 on peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW We further estimate 20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time s 20 that amount We recommend that the State of California provide rebates 20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and 20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market 01 Legislative vehi cle 20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re 20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy 20 service providers Ironically AB1X takes that important option away from 20 customers and businesses It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th e 20 prohibition against Direct Access Enron s legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a 20 direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department o f 20 Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from 20 customer migration 20 In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when 20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function Procureme nt 20 is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial 20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves California should 20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement 20 function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a 20 non utility provider within 36 months To execute the transition Californ ia 20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36 month period in 20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments 20 of utility load Return California 01 s Investor owned utilities to solvency 01 Legislative vehicle 20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand 20 In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve California 01 s supply demand 20 imbalance In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers 20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ ia 20 State government assume the role of 01 electricity buyer 018 for an extend ed 20 period of time Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc e 20 in California s energy markets and the private sector s willingness to 20 participate in that market California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a 20 series of staged rate increases California should design those rate 20 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without 20 01 shocking 018 the economy or household budgets For example California c ould 20 amortize the recovery of the utilities 01 past debt over a 5 10 year perio d 20 In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways 20 First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in 20 recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 20 1890 Second California can 01 net 018 the revenues the utilities have r eceived 20 from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav e 20 accrued due to the retail price cap

Enron Joe Hartsoe Corp Enron ENRON Sarah Novosel Corp Enron ENRON dwatkiss bracepatt com awenner velaw com cc Subject New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language Yesterday Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by independent market analysts i e A rating for Holding Companies or investment grade rating for utility companies This is not a permanent exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating MidAmerican s lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay s reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could Reportedly Ken Lay was non committal but not negatively disposed The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey D NE offer this as an amendment to a must pass piece of legislation during the waning days of this Congressional session This will be separate from the utilities strategy to enact Private Use legislation H R 4971 S 2967 which includes tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily for Commonwealth Edison and to enact stand alone Reliability legislation S 2071 and H R 2944 Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm R TX about this PUHCA amendment and Gramm was reportedly non committal but not negatively disposed to the idea I will follow up with Gramm s staff next week after they ve reviewed it and convey their views to you According to MidAmerican the concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was Senator Kerrey s idea It is possible that Congressman Dingell D MI and Congressman Markey D MA would still actively oppose this limited exemption especially given the fact that Congressman Dingell who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the Democrats regain control of the House has recently said that whether or not he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress that comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is at least three years away from happening Steve and Rick can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position on this amendment As a reminder Enron s position here to date has been to oppose stand alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like Southern Company really want To date this strategy has worked with the MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support

wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking garage Baker Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage Although not fully agreed there is strong interest on both sides Besides help on the development front we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any issues involving the new convention hotel where we are also providing development management The Rockets Mike Goldberg Baker Botts have talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this should be the Authority s idea One issue is how much of our fee would apply to the garage which presumably the city would pick up and how much would apply to the Arena Since this is a fast moving issue I wanted you to know about this Obviously the discussions are all very confidential If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting please give me a call at 713 966 2606 Also on another topic we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky brainstorming on the concept

and needs before it explodes as a political issue and perhaps helps head it off in contrast to what happened with gasoline Governor Knowles is the current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission and it will be under the auspices of the IOCC They promise at least seven governors and a lot of other distinguished people It seems to us that this is a very timely event They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker I will be kicking off the conference It looks to be a very good and high visibility platform And they would be very keen and excited and honored to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule It takes place in Columbus Ohio on September 20 Tony is a very good guy and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very large for him You ll enjoy talking with him He can certainly fill you in further on what they would like to accomplish If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest that would be great On behalf of

Subject Board Metting Dates Mike has suggested that we cut back board meetings to fewer than the eight 8 we currently hold In order to give you some background Linda checked other peer companies and the meetings range from 6 to 8 a year I think that we can cut back to 6 however it may be more prudent to drop to 7 this year and first see how it goes The two meetings that can be dropped most easily are June or September June because we have the two day strat plan meeting in July and Sept because we don t yet have 4th quarter results and not a lot of new information is available I think that the board meetings take up an incredible amount of Compaq executive time and energy I would rather have them concentrate on getting 6 or 7 meetings right getting the company back on track and increasing earnings So my vote is to recommend to the board that we eliminate the September 01 meeting That is a particularly busy month for many people as exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September meeting 5 members In looking back we seem to be able to fill the house in June On the other hand you all may want to continue with the number of meetings we currently have I will await your

reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion about 30 million of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio

of Northumbria for help with her garden project I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this we should say a polite no The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O Neill Managing Director of Lurgi Invent Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really is difficult to justify any Wessex help Lurgi Invent has done a little work for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden However this business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent Given the nature of the project the approach from the Duchess and the fact that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself we really do believe no is the right answer Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to correspond direct with the Duchess Best wishes Colin

General Counsel for Energy Africa Amina Benkhadra General Manager of ONAREP 25 added to the growing list of re entrants to Morocco signing a petroleum agreement with Energy Africa 63 75 and Taurus Petroleum AB 11 25 This agreement taking effect March 1st 2001 concerned three exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit Offshore area Energy Africa Morocco Ltd operator together with Taurus Petroleum co partner will implement exploration work on the three permits of the Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq km This is Energy Africa s second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco the first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20 equity bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18 000sq km Andrew Windham said the country has all the characteristics offshore which make potentially for substantial discoveries But at this stage it is very much untried and untested so it is a very exciting place to be at the moment We are in right at the start of some new plays For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum Bulletin REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY London Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during exploration in Libya The well in the Murzuq Basin 800km south of Tripoli produced oil at a rate of 1 300bbl d the company said in a press release Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum Repsol began searching for oil in the area in May 1998 when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and production sharing arrangements with foreign companies The companies currently produce more than 160 000bbl d from the Murzuq Basin said the company AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC Tripoli Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel Karim Ahmed has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC following reports that he had been removed from the position Representing Libya at the OPEC conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al Badri has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security The news will comfort foreign investors who feared

EUROPE COVER STORY 01 ALAN GREENSPAN FEELING THE HEAT 20 Can he fight off a new economy recession 20 By Peter Coy in New York with Rich Miller in Washington Linda Himelstein 20 and Jim Kerstetter in San Mateo Jeff Green in Detroit Marcia Vickers and 20 Pete Engardio in New York and bureau reports 20 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has guided and presided over the 20 longest economic expansion in the history of the U S But now the 20 75 year old Greenspan faces an agonizing challenge an abrupt economic 20 slowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands All of Greenspa n 01 s training and experience have taught him how to cope with conventional 20 downturns And so far he 01 s dealing with this one in the conventional ma nner 01 by cutting short term interest rates in quick but measured steps That may 20 well prove to be the right course But there 01 s a risk that this downturn is 20 different and that far steeper cuts in interest rates are needed to keep th e 20 New Economy from tumbling into a long and painful recession 20 In short Alan Greenspan is feeling the heat of a market in tatters and an 20 economy that by some measures appears to be on the brink And after ridin g 20 triumphantly astride the economic boom times his very legacy is suddenly a t 20 stake 20 20 ASIA COVER STORY ASIA 01 S BIG CHILL 20 Caught between Japan 01 s weak yen policy and the steep U S downturn the 20 region 01 s fragile economies may see their recent gains swept away 20 By Brian Bremner in Tokyo with Frederick Balfour in Bangkok Michael Shari 20 in Singapore Moon Ihlwan in Seoul and Pete Engardio in New York 20 The U S is clearly worried about Japan falling into a catastrophic slide 20 But Washington may not have a clear view of another huge problem How 20 decisions in Tokyo could undermine the precarious economic state of other 20 Asian nations In South Korea and also in Southeast Asia the export led 20 recovery of the past two years is starting to slow because of the downturn in 20 the U S economy Growth in Korea Thailand Malaysia Singapore and 20 Indonesia is expected to slow this year to between 3 and 4 The last 20 thing these economies need is to compete for a dwindling export market with a 20 Japan now reliant on a weaker yen Many of the economies of East and 20 Southeast Asia are trying to shake off a triple blow The U S slowdown is 20 putting a dent in exports Second Japan is yanking investment from the 20 region and now there 01 s the yen threat Finally China is soaking up a 20 growing slice of foreign investment a trend that will accelerate once it 20 enters the World Trade Organization 20 20 ASIA IS CATCHING THE JAPANESE DISEASE 20 Commentary by Pete Engardio 20 It 01 s a terrible malady for young economies The symptoms banks

Tetovo from Mar 14 19 NATO officials announced plans to bolster 20 patrols on the Kosovo border with Macedonia Both European and U S 20 diplomats hope Macedonian forces will subdue the rebels But if the fightin g 20 keeps up pressure will grow on NATO to play a more active role That could 20 involve a controversial decision to send NATO troops to combat rebels in 20 Macedonia Washington however

Indian government stands on the brink of collapse The event that did t he 20 damage a sting operation by an online magazine which caught leading 20 politicians and military officials on camera accepting bribes in connection 20 with what they thought were military contracts Defense Minister George 20 Fernandes has since quit along with the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party 20 Raucous opposition legislators closed Parliament for six days insisting th at 20 the government step down The administration should be embarrassed But it 20 would be a huge mistake for the opposition to initiate a new era of politic al 20 turmoil The principal casualty would be much needed reform Yet India 20 desperately needs to get its house in order Last year it took in only 2 6 20 billion in foreign direct investment Most important are the proposed 20 reforms of the labor laws which for the first time would permit companies 20 with fewer than 1 000 employees to hire and fire without government 20 permission Freed from these restrictions business owners could invest in 20 promising new ventures instead of wallowing in sunset industries So inste ad 20 of seeking to stall change the

Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA Last year the event was a great success raising over 70 000 This year s goal is to raise 100 000 so the fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised The money raised will be used to further research for ALS Lou Gehrig s Disease I have put together a team of Analyst interns Howard Goldfarb Rachel McPhaul Nicole Brady Bradley Aiken and myself for a second year to help in this cause The benchmark for the team is the raise 600 pre matching but I want to outdo the fundraising of 1400 post matching we did last year I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event Checks are payable to MDA FYI Enron matches all donations 20 or more The event will take place on Saturday July 29 2000 Please let me know if you have any questions
