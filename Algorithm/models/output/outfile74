cc Subject wed aftn thursday I will be in the office on wed aftn and all day thursday I would like to catch up with all of you not sure of people s schedules but please advise me of your availability and hope most of you can make it for dinner on thur I will list some important things to me that I would like to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 2001 teamwork communication teaching guidance leadership these are the major areas we should be thinking about how we can improve teamwork I feel we look at each commodity crude light distillates middle distillates heavy distillates lpg petrochemicals as a separate business try to identify team leaders to provide direction for that business establish resources required to meet proposed budgets and work on individual limits for the traders in those groups communication once we have established global teams this should improve significantly the road to hell is paved with good intentions and until traders bonuses are directly tied to the profitability of someone in another office I don t think we will communicate as effectively we need to we have very few niche markets to exploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of our physical traders the ability to trade well without a strong understanding of the push pull forces at work from the other centers for the last two years this has been cited a main area for improvement to get to where we want to be I feel it has to be done through global books teaching given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiring from the outside and toward internal recruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent also given the lack of depth in our trading group it is important that our best traders be given the additional responsibility for development of talent in their teams guidance I feel that if we move toward smaller business units it will be easier for individuals to understand what the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is we lost a lot of people at this time last year and the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn t see where this group was headed leadership with a group of 114 people at last count it is important to start thinking about ways to encourage more people to make a greater personal investment in making this group a success not just meeting a budget but also in creating a business that will survive the exit of any individual a business that will have a competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highly motivated to keep growing if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we can analyse how we go about it I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of our weaknesses chemistry is the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of each group there are many other important issues such as eol marketing team research group recruitment etc but I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with the exisitng group and then figure out how to try to build upon it look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please
