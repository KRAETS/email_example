170 Elsa V 5 games 170 Danny Conner 5 games 170 Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game We need to draft this week I will set the rotation by number of tickets purchased to start the rotation then random draw In other words I will pick 1st Greg 2nd Stacey Jason 3rd 4th I will flip a coin that day and Eric Elsa and Danny to follow we will draw an order that day So in summary there are 16 packages of 5 games so every 16 games I will get 5 Greg 4 Jason and Stacey 2 and the other 3 one So round 1 would look like this 1 Gary 2 Greg 3 Jason Stacey 4 Jason Stacey Picks 5 16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all remaining picks with Gary s name 4 times Greg 3 times and every one else once We need to do this this week How about Wednesday Thursday or Friday from 11 00 1 00 we should finish earlier The schedule is at astros mlb com or I will bring hard copies for you Please

ECT Zachary McCarroll Enron Communications Enron Communications James Wininger NA Enron cc Subject Box Score Banter The following question and statistical numbers come via J C Corrigan of Richmond Va He asks Which conference is best Pac 0 ACC SEC Big 10 Big 12 Big East Using the RPI I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference ACC is the smallest in terms of members and I threw out their Russian judge team If you were to add these individual team RPI up the least sum would indicate the greatest depth Big Ten 178 SEC 194 Big East 246 Big 12 278 ACC 369 Pac 10 382 Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams since half are forced into a losing record Others say only one team can win so why concern yourself with the bottom feeders To refute that here s what the sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference SEC 40 Pac 10 41 ACC 48 Big Ten 49 Big East 66 Big 12 69 If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders then we want to make sure there are no gimmies for those teams on top So what s the RPI rating of the lowest team in each conference SEC 103 LSU Big Ten 135 Northwestern Big 12 157 Texas Tech Big East 167 Virginia Tech ACC 168 Clemson Pac 10 173 Washington State Others will argue that we should include each team and then normalize based on the number of teams per conference This will also account for the small differences between teams and reward second tier team strength Here are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI SEC 39 1 38 5 Big Ten 39 4 29 0 Big East 45 2 49 0 ACC 59 7 35 0 Big 12 66 7 47 0 Pac 10 70 8 55 0 This data clearly shows how top heavy the ACC Big 12 and Pac 10 are But who s the best When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these five categories SEC 2 1 1 1 3 8 Big Ten 1 4 2 2 1 10 Big East 1 5 4 3 4 17 ACC 5 3 5 4 2 19 Big 12 4 6 3 5 4 22 Pac 10 6 2 6 6 6 26 The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten but some may say the RPI is biased So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings SEC 10 Big 10 11 ACC 12 Big 12 20 Pac 10 22 Big East 29 Personally I think the RPI is a little more accurate Hope you found this interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book Ideally I would like to include head to head competition and run these numbers but I m an amateur and I don t that much time on my hands Get your FREE download of

Successful Cookbook Author in America Dulles VA Xpress Press Successful Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran celebrates the culture of her homeland in THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK an easy to follow guide to Vietnamese cuisine In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi Minh s North Vietnamese troops The pregnant 20 year old had no idea where she was going or what she would do when she arrived and was forced to make a new life for herself in a foreign country Over the past two decades she has gone from not knowing a word of English to being a successful clothing designer and dressmaker with clients in the upper echelons of politics media and society Yet despite her success in America Diana staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage I want to keep our family heritage alive es pecially for my children The easiest way to do that is through the food She says that when she first came to America she missed the many joyous family celebrations and their acc ompanying feasts and tried to recreate them for her new friends in America When I first arrived in America cooking Vietnamese dishes was a challenge because there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA Most of the time I could not find the tradi tional ingredients and had to make substitutions but the food turned out just fine she says Diana recorded all of these substitutions in her cookbook keeping the original tastes and textures The recipes make use of ingredients easily found in local supermarkets and show step by step instructions for making the healthy delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply My time for cooking is as limited as it ever was when I was a new immigrant Tran says Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and effort to prepare time I usually don t have so I have created my own easier versions of Vietn amese dishes tailored to the busy American lifestyle Diana s cookbook has been featured in The Washington Post The Chicago Sun Times Charlotte Observer Arkansas Democrat Gazette and the Portland Press Herald Diana has also appeared on Fox Noon News in Washington DC and Poor Man s Kitchen in Seattle WA She is available for inter views about her family s flight from Saigon and her American success story For feedback purposes we are interested in hearing from you whether you found the information in this E zine to be valuable

Even if you don t particularly like zoos Everything I read says that it will take at least half a day I say we hit that Friday morning through early afternoon Spend mid afternoon near the hotel beach area suppose to be shopping etc near there Then go to the game When we get back that night we can walk on the beach Saturday Visit Balboa Park See the Botanical Gardens in other musuems gardens in the area that look interesting If we aren t sick of seeing animals there is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking tours the tours are only like an hour and a half After that there is a ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del Coronado It is suppose to be a really neat place Then you we can finish the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown It is suppose to have a lively evening street scene and live music What do you think Let me know so I can look up times that all of these open if we are interested Shanna

that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help E To whom it may concern I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6 05 AM on 12 9 00 for Phoenix and catch a 10 00 AM connection to Telluride the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride Unfortunately the flight was cancelled due to the re routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area I do not blame America West for this It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions There is however no danger involved in taking off in these conditions which leads me to the point of this complaint Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re routing us on another airline Continental United American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection so that we could make our connection Instead we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection Subsequently I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have delivered us to Phoenix on time It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride Instead of arriving in Telluride Co at 12pm on 12 9 we arrived at 10pm a full ten hours later This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience For your research I provide the following data Persons in Party Eric Bass Larry Bass Kathy Bass

Senior Writer Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night s game against the New York Giants SportsLine com has confirmed If it was just a problem with Brad then we d look at it but that s not the case coach Norv Turner said But it goes beyond just the quarterback position It s more than that We re not playing well on offense in general Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team s starter against the unbeaten Giants AP In the wake of the Redskins 27 21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants The Washington offense one of the league s most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No 2 overall and second in scoring has been sporadic at best in three games A seventh year veteran who is in the final season of his contract Johnson has five interceptions the last two games including four in the fourth quarters of those losses He has not been sharp in either his play calling or his execution and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards and the longest is 26 yards In Monday s defeat the team s longest play was a 17 yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis The Redskins who averaged 12 7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18 plus yards are averaging an anemic 9 2 yards per catch this season But Turner who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter There hasn t been any thought to switching

summer away Come winter the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving CBS NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food America is stunned by the sharp contrast How can this be that in a country of such wealth this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing It s Not Easy Being Green Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers or as Bill refers to it as Temperatures of the 80 s Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant s house where the news stations film the group singing We shall overcome Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper s sake Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share Finally the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity and Anti Grasshopper Act Retroactive to the beginning of the summer The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes his home is confiscated by the government Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare recipients who can only hear cases on Thursday s between 1 30 and 3 00 PM when there are no talk shows scheduled The ant loses the case The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant s food while the government house he is in which just happens to be the ant s old house crumbles around him since he doesn t maintain it The ant has disappeared in the snow And on the TV which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant s food they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of fairness has dawned in America The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house now abandoned is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood

have finally surfaced I did not even say anything to your father until today First of all I expected to see 3 smiling faces when I awoke in the recovery room I only saw one I was devastated I will get over it but it has to run its course Nothing would have prevented me from being by either one of your sides under similar circumstances I know you have lives work etc but you especially always find time for friends in need i e Donnita s mother and Donnita s 15 minute oral surgery Give me a break But the most heart wrenching thing is until today you never gave it a second thought How would you have felt if I had not been there for you The final blow though was the realization that you would take time to be with somebody else s mother and take an entire day off for Donnita s oral surgery Actions speak louder than words I ll get over this In fact I ve gotten it off my chest and this is the end of it But I cannot help but wonder and I want you both to answer this truthfully if it had

Taylor ENRON Gateway George Smith HOU ECT ECT Subject I need your help Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU finance major who has been working in Logistics for the Central Desk He will be at ENA for the next couple of weeks through 8 11 I believe He has not had an opportunity to really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective I had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday and we brainstormed on some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA THis where I need your help Eric As I always do I sang your praises to Mike and I thought you would be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk Additionally since you were in Risk also I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role If you can swing it I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day and you could explain to him your job your thoughts behind your actions the data you watch etc Obviously the intent is educational not interference So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best approach and timing Dave As I mentioned to you yesterday I sang your praises also to Mike and I m glad the two of you were able to meet As we discussed Mike would like to have some exposure to the Risk role so it would be nice if he could sit with the group when the books and position are being calced I will leave it to the two of you to coordinate the day Mike s current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4 00am to prepare the morning report As I understand it his responsibilities are critical up until trading So late morning and early afternoon might be the best time but you all can work through it When he sits with Risk he ll probably go home and them return when you all start calcing George Obviously Mike s first responsibilities are to Central Logistics and these other opportunities are really on his own time We just thought it would be good for him to have a Risk Trading perspective when he is trying to evaluate job opportunities I appreciate your support in this but please let me know if you have any concerns When Mike leaves Enron he will be going to Seattle to participate in MicroSoft s co op program for the reaminder of 2000 Obviously he will have a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day we want to ensure he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer I appreciate your time to help Mike

don t want to be rude he said last week I just wish they d stop 20 asking I love them appreciate them but it s getting a little Got the picture OK So here s the word Applewhite is 100 percent 01 even ahead of schedu le Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba ck 20 Chris Simms who with only one career start has graced the cover of The 20 Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we ek This word on Applewhite s fitness comes not just from the junior player bu t 20 from the man who s worked most closely with him physical therapist Allen 20 Hardin Applewhite Hardin stresses unequivocally is ready to play now Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range 20 when he s had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg 20 During rehab Hardin ditched the pool work concentrating instead on 20 sport specific movements shortly after Applewhite observed that very few 20 football games are played under water One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi th 20 rubber tubing as the quarterback moved cut and set up strengthening his 20 supporting muscles and improving his balance If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday he wasn t happy 20 because he wanted to be challenged Hardin said It was a challenge to co me 20 up with things to challenge him The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm 20 up Applewhite said I ll jog for four minutes instead of two stretch fo r 20 six minutes instead of five After workouts Applewhite dutifully ices his knee though he does so based 20 more on conventional wisdom than necessity I ve always heard you can get tendinitis so I ice it he said I don t 20 have any of the symptoms so it feels like I m icing it for no reason In some ways Applewhite feels he s better for the injury not the least of 20 which being a renewed appreciation for the game So what if I m tired he said I can rest when I die Resting now isn t a bad thing either Applewhite said missing spring drill s 20 was a boon for his arm I was throwing so much during the spring of 1999 summer and season that 20 it felt like my arm was run ragged he said Of course the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite 20 takes a hit in the fall The other question the one that he can t shake 20 will take a little longer Who s the starter going to be 01 Applewhite or Simms I d be quick to drop in comments about Chris Hardin said of his 20 occasional and apparently unnecessary mention of Simms as a motivational 20 ploy But I think internally he d have worked that hard whatever It s remarkable the way he s come back said sophomore cornerback Roderic k 20 Babers noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the 20 speediest receivers in workouts In two a days it ll be a fair fight Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts 20 Babers said I think Simms has the advantage Major s been sitting out a nd 20 Simms confidence is up big time That s what you need in a quarterback B ut 20 at the same time Major s a veteran He s beaten Nebraska He s beaten them 20 all He s the same old Major cornerback Quentin Jammer said Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback 20 duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee Now a 20 month before the freshmen report on Aug 13 he s talking about how he s no t 20 competing against Simms just against himself The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I 20 have Applewhite said At Pebble Beach Tiger was up 15 and had a 10 foot er 20 on the last hole for birdie and he was out there lining it up He could ha ve 20 done the Happy Gilmore tap to the hole and still won But he wanted it al l Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds working on his leg and upper bo dy 20 strength I feel like there s more to me now that it s not like the wind s going to 20 blow me over he said I don t want to be a wimpy quarterback I want to be 20 like Brett Favre He s not the biggest or the fastest but he can run when he 20 has to and he can chuck it 80 yards It s going to come and it ll get worse Simms said of the building 20 scrutiny To tell you the truth I don t care Football s a competitive 20 sport There s nothing you can do about it So he shrugs it off for now concentrating on finishing up summer school 20 He s working on his topic for a writing course History of American 20 Baseball The book he chose is about Babe Ruth In August the topic switches to college football The question remains the 20 same And Chris Simms or Major Applewhite won t write this story They ll live it

asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door Half awake and nearly paralyzed with fear you hear muffled whispers At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way With your heart pumping you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun You rack a shell into the chamber then inch toward the door and open it In the darkness you make out two shadows One holds a weapon it looks like a crowbar When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike you raise the shotgun and fire The blast knocks both thugs to the floor One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside As you pick up the telephone to call police you know you re in trouble In your country most guns were outlawed years before and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless Yours was never registered Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm When you talk to your attorney he tells you not to worry authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter What kind of sentence will I get you ask Only ten to twelve years he replies as if that s nothing Behave yourself and you ll be out in seven The next day the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper Somehow you re portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys Their friends and relatives can t find an unkind word to say about them Buried deep down in the article authorities acknowledge that both victims have been arrested numerous times But the next day s headline says it all Lovable Rogue Son Didn t Deserve to Die The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood type pranksters As the days wear on the story takes wings The national media picks it up then the international media The surviving burglar has become a folk hero Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you and he ll probably win The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you ve been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects After the last break in you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars A few months later you go to trial The charges haven t been reduced as your lawyer had so confidently predicted When you take the stand your anger at the injustice of it all works against you Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean vengeful man It doesn t take long for the jury to convict you of all charges The judge sentences you to life in prison This case really happened On August 22 1999 Tony Martin of Emneth Norfolk England killed one burglar and wounded a second In April 2000 he was convicted and is now serving a life term How did it become a crime to defend one s own life in the once great British Empire It started with the Pistols Act of 1903 This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987 Michael Ryan a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw When the smoke cleared 17 people were dead The British public already de sensitized by eighty years of gun control demanded even tougher restrictions The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle Nine years later at Dunblane Scotland Thomas Hamilton used a semi automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school For many years the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable or worse criminals Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law abiding gun owners Day after day week after week the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns The Dunblane Inquiry a few months later sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self defense came to be seen as vigilantism Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened claiming that self defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released Indeed after the Martin shooting a police spokesman was quoted as saying We cannot have people take the law into their own hands All of Martin s neighbors had been robbed numerous times and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences

Careers in Sports ESPN Classic SportsFigures Sports JEOPARDY Training Room Vid Game Reviews Tuesday May 30 Mock draft No 1 Mihm s the word By Andy Katz ESPN com With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere between few and none this year s selections will be based on the potential of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams NBA scouts general managers and player personnel directors are banking heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre draft camp June 6 9 Because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily this is the first of several projections we ll have on ESPN com A number of players still have work to do to earn first round spots but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and or a strong showing in Chicago The borderline first rounders who didn t make ESPN com s list but have a chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush LSU senior center Jabari Smith Temple junior guard Mark Karcher UCLA freshman guard Jason Kapono Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal Connecticut junior point guard Khalid El Amin Indiana senior guard A J Guyton Ohio State senior point guard Scoonie Penn Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock Ohio State junior guard Michael Redd Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens Turkey forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must decide if it s worth the risk to stay in the draft Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school Rush El Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft regardless of what happens ESPN com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22 Chris Mihm Mihm towered over much of the competition in college 1 New Jersey Chris Mihm 7 0 Jr Texas The Nets need a center and could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin but the pick here is Mihm The Nets could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next season or deal it to the Bulls for the No 4 and No 7 picks 2 Vancouver Kenyon Martin 6 9 Sr Cincinnati The Grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No 2 He s the hardest working player in the draft and with a healthy leg the most effective low post scorer Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur Rahim and Bryant Reeves If the Grizzlies aren t ready to go with Martin he makes for a tantalizing trade 3 Los Angeles Clippers Stromile Swift 6 9 So LSU The Clippers have already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small power forward which goes against LSU coach John Brady s philosophy of how to use him defensively But if Swift knows he s going to the Clips he could opt to return to school He has said he will not hire an agent leaving the door open for a return 4 Chicago Joel Przybilla 7 0 Soph Minnesota The Bulls need a center for their triangle offense If they can t trade for Mihm Przybilla is next in line He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls championship runs 5 Orlando Marcus Fizer 6 8 Jr Iowa State The Magic love Darius Miles but won t let Fizer drop below No 5 if he s available Fizer gives the Magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic 6 Atlanta Mike Miller 6 8 Soph Florida The Hawks have been high on Miller for a month and won t let him slide past them Miles might be a better scorer but Miller s versatility will win the Hawks over at No 6 Atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard 7 Chicago Darius Miles 6 9 HS East St Louis Ill The Bulls can package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy McGrady Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for Miles to develop 8 Cleveland Iakovos Tsakalidis 7 1 Greece The Cavs want size and the third rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis The Celtics covet him too but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt Reviews on Tsakalidis are split either scouts love him or think he s too slow 9 Houston Courtney Alexander 6 5 Sr Fresno State Alexander could go higher but not above six The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce during individual workouts The choice of Alexander DeShawn Stevenson DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue Alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game 10 Orlando DeShawn Stevenson 6 5 HS Washington Union Fresno Calif The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks If Miles is gone Stevenson will be too by No 11 Orlando has scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season 11 Boston DerMarr Johnson 6 9 Fr Cincinnati Johnson can t slip past 11 with his Lamar Odom like skills on the wing The Celtics need size but can t let a scorer get past them in the draft Johnson learned defense from Max Good and Bob Huggins so Rick Pitino s pressure defense shouldn t be much different 12 Dallas Mamadou N diaye 7 0 Sr Auburn Trying to predict what Don Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft But the Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt They can t afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man N diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in Chicago if he shows 13 Orlando Mateen Cleaves 6 2 Sr Michigan State The Magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks but no one is good enough to spend the No 5 or No 10 pick on Cleaves is at the top of the point guard list list and would fit Rivers style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness 14 Detroit Morris Peterson 6 6 Sr Michigan State The Pistons won t let the local hero leave the state Peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency Peterson could go higher if he s gone the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson 15 Milwaukee Etan Thomas 6 9 Sr Syracuse The Bucks want a power forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin Fizer and Swift None will be available by the time they pick Thomas can give them a rebounder and defender something they lacked in their playoff losses to the Pacers 16 Sacramento Erick Barkley 6 1 Soph St John s The Kings need a backup point to Jason Williams Barkley could come in and wouldn t be under any pressure to perform immediately He s the No 2 point guard behind Cleaves 17 Seattle Quentin Richardson 6 6 Soph DePaul Had Richardson stayed he would have probably been in the lottery next season But he doesn t fit all of the teams needs above which is why he falls all the way to the Sonics He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis if he re signs 18 Los Angeles Clippers Keyon Dooling 6 3 Soph Missouri The Clippers need a point guard but won t take one at No 3 Dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don t carry into the draft But the potential of being a mid teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school 19 Charlotte Jerome Moiso 6 10 Soph UCLA Moiso could still slide up into the late lottery maybe to Dallas but if he falls the Hornets will catch him Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket The Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft 20 Philadelphia Jamal Crawford 6 6 Fr Michigan The Sixers have already called on Crawford s behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he s in the first round regardless of where he s being picked 21 Toronto Craig Speedy Claxton 5 11 Sr Hofstra The Raptors have already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five If Cleaves Barkley Dooling and Crawford are all gone Claxton is the natural pick for the Raptors 22 New York Jamaal Magloire 6 11 Sr Kentucky The Knicks took some heat for taking Frederic Weis last year Jeff Van Gundy wants tough physical players Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post 23 Utah Hanno M tt l 6 9 Sr Utah The Jazz can t go wrong with picking M tt l from nearby Utah He can score from the wing but he ll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward If M tt l doesn t go to the Jazz he could slip out of the first round 24 Chicago Jeryl Sasser 6 7 Jr SMU The Bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can t go after one in the lottery The most intriguing point guard left could be Sasser He can play both guard positions he s one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the Bulls some versatility on the floor 25 Phoenix Jason Collier 7 0 Sr Georgia Tech The Suns need another big guy to go with Luc Longley either as a backup or on the floor together Collier has more offensive potential than many big men The Suns have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center 26 Utah Chris Carrawell 6 6 Sr Duke The Jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State s Desmond Mason Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree He could still go higher but his tweener status fits more as a late first round pick 27 Indiana Donnell Harvey 6 8 Fr Florida Harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts and he didn t leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round The Pacers have a history of going younger in the draft 28 Portland Soumaila Samake 7 2 Cincinnati Stuff IBL The Blazers don t need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA Samake has the size shot blocking skills and potential to be an NBA center Arvydas Sabonis doesn t have many miles left in his legs 29 Los Angeles Lakers Desmond Mason 6 6 Sr Oklahoma State Here s where any one of the bubble players could go such as Rush Karcher or Stephens But Mason is a more polished experienced player He gives the Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system Andy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN com ALSO SEE NBA draft order Nets weigh M M s Mihm and Martin Early entry

Portfolio has been segregated from the rest of HPLC s Physical Portfolio As a result of this segregation it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly accrual value can be determined This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately 275 000 of accrual value per month The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status accrual term deals actual volumes greater than booked half cent bid to mid spread incorrect markings and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs Of the above Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen accrual deals actual volumes greater than or less than booked and deals incorrectly marked Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs such as gas quality issues The breakout of this value has been on average 60 to Greg and 40 to Tom The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value January Total Accrual Value 266 504 Greg s Value Tom s Value Evergreen Value 140 750 Bid to Mid 105 000 Accrual Value 53 000 Accrual Costs 13 000 Actual Volumes Booked 60 000 118 000
