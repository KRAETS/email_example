directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke l oose I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in se arch of a fire extinguisher Didn t find one and like Scott the intern was a bit disappointed in my reactions ah well I don t usually send out a group email but listen to this shit So I am s itting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks lo ose It is about 630am and most of the trading has subsided for the morni ng I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that a re serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food w ill last today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast f rom a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used t o because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enro n employees they usually cook it the night before So everyone on the flo or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs So I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year old women at the grill Everyone is smiling deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w ill get crazy and add salsa or something The next thing you know straigh t out of a FOX tv show or You ve Gotta See This episode this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago The propane tanks he ating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide raising up to te n feet in height The place turns into a frenzy Nobody can move react o r anything Everyone is frozen watching this old woman picture happy Gilmo re s grandma go up like an old Christmas tree A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment I was sitting on the first row right in t he middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk The old woman that went into flames is dire ctly in front of me about a literal three feet away and I am directly faci ng the inferno along with a co worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames I don t save the old woman like most of you might have thou ght I can t do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is g oing to jump in there and save this poor lady The old woman is yelling Somebody get me outta here yet we all continue to stare finally so meone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze Who is this masked man I have no clue However I do witness Les from middle marketing doing hi s best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier which is funny if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on th e old woman ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me and torc hing a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens The alarm in o ur building 3 World Trade Center is screaming and the smoke is enough to m ake even Polarek leave the area So the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital Who know s what condition she is in but all I know is I hope I am never around a bu nch of vaginas myself and the rest of us that did nothing when I go up in flames someday Well I have to get back to work because I have wasted abo ut 20 minutes writing this drama Take care Scotty Enjoyable or what Give me a call and let me know what is up Bill 20 503 274 0502 503 887 3449 cell","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-07-11

was born on the east coast Connecticut moved around for a while and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents I went to highschool in Kelso this is where I met and then graduated with Brendan Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle College was good if a bit long I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis whoa A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with Enron as a trader trading hourly electricity in the West I started out on shift but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule usually 10 12 hours a day during the week I enjoy the job a ton the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop With regards to your visit I ve been in Portland for a few years now so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town Depending on when you get here and how things go we ll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast Astoria is about 2 hours away and it s a pretty scenic drive out there especially if you re from New Mexico If the weather s nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt St Helens and the gorge good swimming hiking etc It should be a blast Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town I am pretty open at the start of July and although it always rains on the 4th EVERY single year that s still a good time to be coming up Besides if you ever thought about moving here you have to understand why its so green It was good to hear from you and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503 887 3449 Take care Bill","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-06-18

and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals Please pay special attention to 5 below So some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals 1 EpmiCalPool deals are BUY RESALE deals a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method 2 We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool no exceptions 3 EpmiCalPool deals have a 0 price in the buy and sell portions Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal 4 EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone Good delivery points would be Malin COB N S COB S N NOB N S NOB S N Cascade Captain Jack Summit Four Corners 345 Mead 230 Paloverde NP 15 ZP 26 SP 15 Bad delivery points would include Mid C Hotsprings Hidalgo BC Border 5 IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO a If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four Corners would be appropriate For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP 15 NP 15 to SP 15 and SP 15 to Four Corners b However from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone for example Malin to SP 15 we will need a Malin to NP 15 and NP 15 to SP 15 This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California

When Dave and I ran through the demonstration I was told th at the East desk had driven most of the development work to date The funct ionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed u seful with little development needed for us to implement it The position manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real Time s cu rrent position and report

manager Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would be delayed until after FSP was in production As a result of the FSP delay I have heard nothing of the position manager and have

and ferc websites national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost Do you do any trading in gas We do not trade gas on real time but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side Canada New Alberta Power Plant Do you move any Canadian electricity We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently though we do not schedule the energy into Canada We deliver the energy to them at the BC US border The CPUC has suspended direct access switches What kind of impact does this have on trading How does California s Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted 500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices A judge said they were just and fair Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor Yes it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades In short its good for Enron and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW Enron and PGE There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN Will this have any effect on you To put it bluntly will you still be able to hire from the outside Will the sale do anything to the 100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price How close are we to having BPA s transmission system under FERC jurisdiction What does Enron think of that or do they care Dynegy Exelon Entergy Cinergy who are these guys Dynegy and Exelon are power companies like Enron Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon Exelon said it would reduce its 2001 estimates due to power market volatility and it would cut an additional 450 positions Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market or did Exelon just do a shitty job That would be the latter SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money What happens if it goes bankrupt How does that affect Enron overall and would it change the daily trading process Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is I believe it is minimal on the trading desk Tell me about Qualifying Facility QF suppliers This will take a while How will green power enter into your mix It doesn t yet Green power just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good Cal ISO s director of grid planning testified that the cost of 1500 MW of new capacity is justified as a way to prevent power sellers market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CA s energy crisis As California creates new capacity will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do or will they just have more power to deal with A long or short market is just a part of trading For example the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have All for now Thanks for the information The acronyms are incredible It was like these things were written in a foreign language Looking forward to hearing from you The acronyms are incredible but they all make sense after a while John

approximately 11 50 At that time I sold him 90 mws at 29 delivered at PV for HE 14 I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14 I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI CISO SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12 20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers I told Bhavin the export EPMI CISO SALSA would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule 90 mws out at PV devers 90 mws in at PV devers Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them At approximately 12 40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled At 13 02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13 I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him He told me he would call his marketer While transacting for HE 15 I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP s end It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice If you have any questions for me please let me know Thank you for your help Bill","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-10-10

substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations I do recognize and appreciate the hard work As always there is more work to be done We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice Some members of the group have experienced limited success others have experienced little to no success A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on So going forward 1 All deals will be done under ST Whourly If there is lending parking or a cut that corresponds to another book we will make that deal for the entire strip for example W BOM sells to EPE for HE 7 22 all one deal We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book this interdesk deal will not be routed We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include transmission charges when necessary In Enpower use strips wherever possible try to avoid extending deals in scheduling 2 All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk for example ST SW exporting from SP 15 to FC MUST be under ST SW in CAPS This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export import fees paid for by the appropriate desk Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for wheeling and or potentially congestion for other desks When filling a Service customer such as Wheelabrator or EES we should pay for the import and export fees 3 A skeleton of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day Sales purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and immediately input into the service sheet Likewise Service deals Lending Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible I would like to implement all of these practices immediately Effective HE 1 08 29 01 THIS is our new business practice Spread the word I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement This will

explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron s ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers I believe that we can provide Warren s group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading Therefore We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated not an estimate Finally sign off the hour in the services book Les has provided us with the needed information for each day Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling

lacked an honor among thieves but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now sch Is Enron the New Drexel By Michael Lewis the author of Liar s Poker and The New New Thing Berkeley California Dec 20 Bloomberg Enron Corp is rapidly expanding the American business journalists notion of what is possible No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true The boss Kenneth Lay was a friend of the current president of these United States an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers The company itself was rated strong buy by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms and plugged endlessly by the business press Six years running as Fortune s most innovative company And all the while this same operation was at the very top a lie Understandably people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation but really there isn t a good one Other than failed hedge fund Long Term Capital Management Michael Milken s junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay Alumni Will Flourish True in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them And in both cases the core business Drexel s junk bonds and Enron s energy trading remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn t go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one time rivals such as Dynegy Inc and Duke Energy Corp Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell the energy trading business will return to normal But the morality of the cases are entirely different Whatever you think of Milken s junk bond department and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones He paid himself huge sums of money but he also made huge sums for his firm He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him and they loved him for it The Enron bosses by contrast pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag Different Motivations Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was Milken created an operation which was if anything much more profitable than it looked What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses This is something I still don t understand and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing The off the books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets Turkish gas pipelines Indian power plants and the like Why did Enron which made its money as an intermediary invest in this stuff in the first place The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel In Drexel s case it took a multiyear investigation by the U S government together with a smear campaign in the press to bring down the business In Enron s case

time market during morning hours we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec bidding or buying back generation that you ve sold forward We want to stress that this is a relatively short term strategy As the weather turns cold during the late Autumn and Winter months the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real time market Lately HE1 10 have been very weak real time ranging between 25 and 40 We have two strategies that we would like to suggest Group We have two important items regarding the services and asset management side of our business First The CAISO has been calling repeatedly regarding outages We will continue to call the CAISO for every outage including when Black Hills goes down 200 kWh Donna has worked closely with the CAISO regarding their new tariff and her information appears below It is very important that we do not expose ourselves to charges by not notifying the CAISO of an outage Second We will be working with the generators to execute buy backs or supplemental dec bids when market conditions warrant Stan has written an email to the generators also detailed below Stan and Chris will be contacting the generators over the next few days to review this email with them Afterwards the Real Time group will contact the generators and initiate one of the two strategies when profitable Real Time will retain 50 of the profits over the generator s day ahead profits Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback Thanks Bill I have reviewed documents from the ISO s website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following 1 During a System Emergency a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage and 2 During a Non System Emergency a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour If you have any questions at all I can be reached at extension 7733 Thanks Donna 1 Decremental Supplemental Bids We can submit dec bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate Basically we would be letting the ISO know that we re willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw s from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity You are still paid the day ahead price for the day ahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it from the ISO For example if your cost to generate is 40 and you sell day ahead for 50 you make 10 MWh If the ISO takes the decremental bid and the price is 30 then you make 20 MWh Advantages A relatively large upside the price the ISO charges could actually go negative as large as negative 91 87 Also you would actually be buying from the ISO as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk Disadvantages Ten minute dispatch When we submit decremental bids the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes In addition to the physical problems this might create the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow 2 Buying Back Blocks in the Bi Lateral Market This strategy calls for our real time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi lateral market for below your cost to generate This would call for you to reduce your generation and the energy we buy back in the real time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity Once again you are still paid the day ahead price for the day ahead quantity but instead of generating it you would be buying it at the price paid to buy back the energy As in the previous example if your cost to generate is 40 and you sell day ahead for 50 you make 10 MWh If we can buy back the energy for a price of 30 then you make 20 MWh Additionally if we do buy back the energy we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order Then if the ISO takes the incremental bid you can generate the power and sell for additional profit Advantages No 10 minute dispatch unless a supplemental bid is accepted You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced Also the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage Disadvantage Not as large of an up side as decremental bidding At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy 2 buying back blocks of energy in the bi lateral market Once you and our real time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO We propose a 50 50 profit split above your day ahead profit earned from either of these two strategies If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster Stan Cocke","email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-07-11

at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks lo ose It is about 630am and most of the trading has subsided for the morni ng I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from

the green eggs and ham that we are used t o because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enro n employees they usually cook it the night before So everyone on the flo or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs So I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year old women at the grill Everyone is smiling deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w ill get crazy and add salsa or something The next thing you know straigh t out of a FOX tv show or You ve Gotta See This episode this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago The propane tanks he ating the

information regarding charges from the CAISO the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap 1 The current price cap is 91 87 We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap however we can and should buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers 2 The FERC order specifies a penalty of 100 per mw for underscheduling load greater than 5 per load zone underscheduled Despite the CAISO s repeated protests and the IOU s complete disregard of this order WE can expect to be subject to this penalty 3 When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out of market calls These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack Therefore when power supplies become tight the prices in the expost may actually drop We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible 4 We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market 5 Remember to include CAISO export fees Tie Meter Multipliers import fees and grid management fees in your
