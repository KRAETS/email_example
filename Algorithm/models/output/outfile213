some of the things that I would like to do next week review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same day certainly want to review this in detail with you the issue being that we may not in the short medium term be able to change systems infrastructure to run same day but with a combination of process and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p l new activity p l and position signoff on trade date with officialisation of books on T 1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at same time more for information on this because when we solve market risk reporting issues we will face big push to clean credit exposure reporting process Office of Chair is very insistent on this to replicate if appropriate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts you and I can review early in the week what we are doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe Would defintely welcome this I can walk through the European MO issues trying to identify key operational risk themes top of my list is Metals I would like to spend some time on Metals with you hence the lunch on Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for Metals Brokerage and Merchanting the starting place for this will be the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December discuss the Doorstep process with you and if you deem appropriate your business controllers in the London office who will participate in Doorstep reviews this year clear up and questions and get your input on how to continually improve the process Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting self assessment of Op risk and doorstep this can be done initially in a small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome some more background of why Rick Rick and yourself need the process to be successful I think they understand I have fully promoted it but your asides explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up London s information for the corporate DPR As explained above additionally I would like to walk you through the implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross prioritise all IT development efforts a meeting with Steve Whitaker Mark and Fernley on this would be useful do some planning with you for the February 12 13 ASE certainly in calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one my wife discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London can you let me know some more of this I am uncertain of it discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services The below is a section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow I would like to expand on these and other thoughts particularly the absence of vision strategy documentation for CL Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements note this is my definition of what CL should be doing including Changing Market practices create cashflow messaging within each transaction create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and liquidation re evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes to terms of trade Module Application developments Synergy from internal process changes pulling Settlements and Documentation together elimination of paper fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of payment advices at inception based upon planned trade settlement and at liquidation based upon actual trade settlement In addition I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial Through Nicki Scott I understand that Michael Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up I will also spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there And I plan to meet with Fernley as well Any other suggestions on topics or people to see Can I suggest we also cover Remote offices with Naomi Connell The

Subject anniversary Sally A new idea popped into my head I don t know if it makes things easier or if everyone would like the idea but here goes What if we gathered as a whole family for a couple of days somewhere easy in Texas like the Hill Country Hyatt or somehwere in Galveston or the YO Ranch or somewhere We might spend one night or two plan something fun for the kids get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers spend time playing games whatever just go somewhere easy and just spend a day or two Then at that event we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special and far away trip for them like a four day weekend in San Francisco or somewhere they d really like to go This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved but provide us all an opporunity albeit condensed to get together and Mom and Dad would still get to go someplace fun Maybe we could chip in varying amounts to Mom and Dad s trip so

the thought of this trip could wear thin I would like the opportunity to be together with everyone maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one

is uncertain I want to hammer home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and to review the SAP implementation work both should be in place I will put together a list of issues subjects that I would like to update you on over the next day or so we should be able to use that as a working agenda and a start point for scheduling time If there is anything else you would like to review specifically I will get the necessary preparation done Cheers and Happy New Year Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck 27 12 2000 23 12 To Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT cc Subject Holiday Wrap Up and January Plans Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful I enjoyed my week off before Christmas but certainly felt as if I worked very hard shopping wrapping baking volunteering birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd 3 years old not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season etc It is nice to be back in the office this week although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15 I will fly over on Sunday so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open How does that work with your schedule Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like I certainly wouldn t occupy all of your time during that week but I wouldn t want to make the trip that week if you don t have some time available Let me know and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus information I am in the office all of this week Sally

made to the prior day s portfolio valuation and any material threshold to be specified movements to be reported to risk management for consideration of rerun 4 IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors to be reported to technical support in the event of a failure The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time for completion of the rerun of the

interview this fall for 2001 summer interns In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager Shelley Jones and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron s staffing When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley with no resolution When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns I volunteered to have James Scribner a Senior Director on my team obtain this market information Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data or were not sure how to do so They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions And based on this information I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting As administrators of the program you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two way messaging system I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell executive sponsors for UT and OU respectively they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you Please let me know how this can be resolved With the help of James Scribner and others we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around

Sally Beck 26 09 2000 23 57 To Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT cc Fernley Dyson LON ECT ECT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriff s name your thoughts on the cover note I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but I wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a European note and the means of delivery On the means of delivery I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under John s name if so to whom will the letter be sent Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article Yes apologies if there is confusion With regard to a global message I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities With these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across Agreed but the note was targeted at Europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and Shona Finally a question regarding timing The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated Shona took this to do after Brent s return to Houston for comments to all business controllers I don t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards And not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy in and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report Can we discuss this please see

idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but I wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message and the means of delivery On the means of delivery I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under John s name if so to whom will the letter be sent Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article With regard to a global message I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities With these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across Finally a question regarding timing The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated Shona took this to do after Brent s return to Houston for comments to all business controllers I don t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards And not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy in and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report Sorry that this

Meagan and I have to sort toys at Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12 30 to 4 00 that day has excused us from the trip So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin after 4 00 on

having all of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for Christmas and then we will deliver the presents And Friday is Tyler s birthday with a 102 Dalmation theme planned cake ordered from RJ Goodies but nothing else done yet So I really think that our only shot to make it to Austin is for Monday night which would mean only Meagan and me I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for Christmas I don t really think that they will come but if they do I hope that doesn t mess up your Christmas They have only been here for one or two Christmases with us since we have had kids I think that Tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled And next year they will have 2 grandchildren in Austin so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come She said she would think about it and I told her that I wanted her to know that we would love to have them but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not

know about this requirement Obviously we want to meet Skilling s request with information that is as timely accurate and complete as possible Therefore we were concerned about feeds from London that over the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component V R Mike I assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 8 30 meeting I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre PRC meeting to meet with Ted Shona Ramesh and me at 4 00 today Realizing that the time was very late in London we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting Since we could not do so we continued without you given that Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow Here is the key fact to know It takes 3 hours to run the component V R calculations once all inputs have been received and processed The Component V R calculations are kicked off at 6 30 am Houston time producing an approximate completion time of 9 30 am Houston time With this timeframe our goal would be to have the component V R report to Jeff by approximately 10 00 am Houston time Given current calculation times in order to consistently calc component V R including all London feeds London books UK power UK gas and Nordic power will have to be completed calculated and officialized by 4 00 am Houston time 10 00 am London time If this time frame is not met then component V R reports for Jeff will be incomplete We had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10 00 am London requirement for officialized books The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on what we understand to be an almost completed task of including UK spread options in V R calculations using the V R engine Those V R calculations that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the component V R calculations While there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component V R reports they are deemed to be less material than the UK spread options Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed Mike we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens I should note that the firm 10 00 am deadline for officializing books in the UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10 00 am Houston time We don t know what Jeff s expectation will be regarding timing It is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning Mike I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 10 00 am deadline

number of resumes to review that would have been an impossible task to complete by Thursday at noon I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma I asked Patti to make a copy of the packet for Brent and I knew that Rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way back to Houston today all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes and Brent reviewed them last night after his training class We got those to Rick today by noon as he was leaving the office I believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will pass the resumes along to you Since you only e mailed your spreadsheet this morning after Brent and I had done our reviews you will have to cross reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well I would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review The plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent If you are going to ask VP s and MD s to help in this process in a very short time frame then I would suggest that you use their time wisely If someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA s or majors that would have given us a good starting point instead of a jumble of resumes Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of MBA s included which should be considered for Associates interviews not Analysts interviews Please give us organized information to react to not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through All of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process but we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and organizational work I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role not being critical I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light Brent and I and I am sure Hunter too would have appreciated

described below You have been identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort and I would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1 2 hour with this team and have your admin spend another hour with them as well times noted below Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this initiative It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to

next week Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort If you have any questions or need further information please do not hesitate to call me at 3 0363 Thanks Jo Ann Proposed agenda We

levels and in all industries This project is supported directly by the HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout SAP in the U S and Germany SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close to our end users To do that we need your help Our goal is to visit eight SAP customers in the U S Enron is one of the eight companies we would like to visit Who do we want to interview and observe In a one day visit we want to observe and interview three types of managers High level manager involved in strategic planning overall budget responsibilities strategic direction The high level manager tends to delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates Operational manager involved in running a large department or small subsidiary Often reports to the high level manager Has budget and personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary May also have product planning responsibilities Group manager primarily focused on a business activity such as accounts payable manager line manager or production planner but also involved in managing a small group Often has hands on personnel and lower level budget responsibilities Concerned with the day to day business What can you expect during a site visit We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to meet with a contact person in your company that would be me who will then escort us to our interviews This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their objectives Our interviews are conducted at the managers workstations where our team will spend about 1 2 hour observing the manager in his her daily work and asking questions We will then spend the next hour with his her administrative assistant Interviewees do not have to prepare anything We prefer to interview people where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of insights about what managers need from a software product We ask people to be completely honest and forthcoming with us We treat all sensitive information with utmost confidentiality There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and administrative assistants from various areas in various business units ","sender_address":"sally.beck@enron.com","message_id":"<18125145.1075855902498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_subject":"Re:

than a party personally so I am glad that Mom and Dad seemed to like that alternative And in June I think that the mountains sound great I have a preference for Western mountains big open sky Grand Tetons could be great but if Mom pictures North Carolina as the spot I am sure that we can find something good We were in Ashville a couple of years ago which was very near the Blue Ridge We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific but we did not care for it I am sure that there are other places in the area to research There may also be some spots around Charlottesville also just off the Blue Ridge I think that some people from here have vacationed in that area so I will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions In magazines I have seen pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia I guess they do have mountains that look nice I will see if I can find the names of those places Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad Sally Cindy White cwhite viviance com on 08 21 2000

of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the United Way I was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused Houston children and the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin and meeting four year old Jessica and ten year old Steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge Enron has a terrific matching

in to work directly with the right management team members on my team I don t think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work I believe that the manual process that moves information from the

Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update GCP I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details They are the logical experts for that discussion Your memo is a little vague on that so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP I believe that these are pretty manual as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP James and Mary I refer to both because James has only

Global Companies Entelligence Much effort has been put forth in cleansing the parent subsidiary information presented in Entelligence yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except for on an ad hoc manual basis What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence Should changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein What process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for Entelligence As we struggle to report trading positions properly let s take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts Your comments and ideas are welcome Debbie

that his organization guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself If James list looks long and involved how could Todd lead these efforts what kind of team might he ask James to provide what additional short term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston etc We have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James If you

yet I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be dancing She did not make the dance for the first try out It was jazz not her strong suit But she did make the dances for the next two try outs a kick rountine and a pom routine There are two more try outs one more for kick and one more for pom Hopefully she will make both Each routines is danced at two games one at home and one away So if she makes the next two dances then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season I think that she would feel pretty good about that The last two try outs will be

this It is interesting to see your thoughts I suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London I told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic However I also told him about my two dark side fears 1 that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need and 2 taken to the extreme that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle Part of the fun in operations is improving things and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions Richard Sage 08 11 2000 10 10 AM To Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT cc Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT Steve Whitaker LON ECT ECT Subject CommodityLogic com Mike Further to our conversation here are some of the things I thought of while speaking with Tom Gros There are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic com as successful as EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara I won t repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron but let s put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution Well that s an easy decision somebody else is doing the hard work and not charging us very much for it So sign up but don t rely on anything until we see everything working Handling counterparties not using the system The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the Hub is wonderful but until everybody is using the Hub we have to keep other procedures and systems going which stretches resources Development IT Support and user This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero the concept is wonderful but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system This is classic Chicken and Egg Tom has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this This is taking us closer to an outsource to Andersen consulting model which is certainly achievable although not quite such an easy sell How much resource is left The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL and then review what is left in the remaining environment Does it mean we hold off doing anything If we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people We should go through costing for What happens if we completely stop development of X project If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing but I hope in most cases it is not Start small to prove concept E g first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields This is excellent and we needn t shout it too loud to investors in CL but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systems We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 years out Include European aspects from the beginning This really isn t very difficult so long as one has some long on common sense Europeans not just Brits involved in both specification and development from the beginning but an as example of how not to do it look at EnPower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc 80 20 rule for types of transaction EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting DTL and risk RisktRAC numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP and yet to become vanilla products on explicitly different manual approaches Until that time we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly Think of certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals and manually tweaked every so often Testing Tom s first thought is that we could leverage initial users who would not pay to do much of the testing EOL clearly got its testing done but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases component system integration end to end and then user acceptance EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process It did have massive resource commandability and so obtained input from many traders Do the Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention Given how often I hear short people that strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional resource even after MG is absorbed What else did you come up with Richard

to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team which will include a discussion on Brent s role and reporting responsibilities Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co ordination between EEL and EGM In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated Separately Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28 That s a lifetime to a trader and Jeff said he

and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees I spoke with Sheila Walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews She indicated that the target completion date should be the end of July Promotions will be effective August 1st It is Dave Delainey s intent to announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24 This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews I do not yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single memo or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo I will keep you updated on this as I get direction from him Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June In order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid year review process we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews It is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews It is important to note however that the content of an employee s review should be consistent with our view of that employee s relative ranking In other words an employee in the Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job Clearly a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory category so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization help you achieve the groups goals etc Also please note the following Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory Needs Improvement or Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given to the employees This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee This has been the stated process for the bottom two categories and we are adding Satisfactory to this process as well Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team yourself or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback I believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations I ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid year PRC process a meaningful one It is Dave Delainey s intent to announce It if

This is great but you are right in that we probably do not have time to cross calibrate for the full global population of Risk Ops perhaps next year Also from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick Causey s PRC ranking process so we are left with lower risk post that Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself My remaining concern is that any promotions particularly in the risk group which are not matched across Houston London or indeed between EGM London and EEL London may create people risk Can I suggest we compare promotions from senior specialist up to manager upwards Hope everything is going well Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck 27 11 2000 20 08 To Mike Jordan LON ECT ECT cc Subject Re Cross calibration for Operations people globally I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston There will be a number of pre review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday December 8th The pre meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule Brent s team in EGM is having pre meetings as well The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA EGM and EIM We will review the results from the pre review meetings for Senior Specialists and below I have asked that the results from the pre review meetings mirror the preferred distribution which as you probably know suggests that 15 of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre review meetings this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy We will take considerably more time as we review the managers who will have been pre ranked as well This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well Finally assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP s who report to me We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing initial

will identify a resource to help insure all internal controls specific to trading activities are in place in India As I understand the plan for coal India will function mostly as an origination unit with the London office being responsible for supplying the coal Therefore the net Enron position will probably be carried in the London books However risk books will still be required in India to determine the net MTM for the 3rd party sales commitments in India These books should include both the intercompany purchase from London and the 3rd party sales The commercial group in India will be responsible for local curves location basis specific usually transportation costs and energy operations this will probably be you initially until the trading activity has grown will be responsible for the deal capture process including contract administration a settlement process and risk management administration daily valuation and reporting of risk books Accounting will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general ledger and financials There will also be a logistics process The following questions need to be addressed With the increased coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be required My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the policy if necessary What trading activities will be performed in India vs London The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure required for the India office Sally s employee starts on Monday I will let you know who she is and arrange a call You can rest assured that although this may seen complicated and it is Sally s Energy Ops team will be able to hold your hand all the way through this process It will be critical

discuss all of these items tomorrow Background As a long time supporter of the analyst program I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program I initiated a meeting announced at Rick Causey s staff meeting that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following Brenda Herod ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead LSU Brent Price ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead UT Jeff Sommers CALME Executive Lead Univsersity of Florida Ed Coats Corp Tax Core Team Member UT A M LSU and University of Florida Sally Beck ENA Energy Operations Executive Lead UT and OU Carolyn Barrett EBS Howard Selzer Enron Global E P Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points One program or two Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999 an announcement was made that there would be one analyst program Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed In fact those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting rotations and orientation We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus SIngle start date The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible a concern from our points of view for an innovative company The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May Lack of communication We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP and yet we have received little information or communication about the program We hear rumors of tracks but no facts or details Some of us had heard about the single July start date and some had not Commercial focus too heavy Presentation materials the attitudes of support staff in the Associates Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs without understanding support needs Lack of input from biggest supporters Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP we are concerned that we haven t been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program We are concerned that decisions example the single start date are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us MSAP has taken a step backward Previously with a dedicated leadership team and staff the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts the quality of candidates the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program Summary Concerns Discussion Points Disc

30 minutes of his time to show his interest in this project and myself I told him that it would be prudent for me to return a month after implementation of the book splits This way I can ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders and the support staff If Brent needs some assistance at that time I could stay for a 2 week span and meet two needs on one trip I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving he said that they are probably trading even more Tim Norton is

to provide whatever assistance training and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000 I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry Richard and some of their direct reports I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products I have not heard from Tani but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey s desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley next week is the best for me to be in London I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London I look forward to meeting with you next week This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton s request By circumstance as you know we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt There will be a similar review of Continental power UK gas UK power and global liquids The review teams are currently focused on operations controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies so I will have those forwarded to you today The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday I can also provide you with a draft of that report the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week he made the trip but was out of the office last week We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them

I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue Since our costs are fully allocated to business units this should be pure margin Hey you have to start somewhere I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg

for the remainder of 2001 For Energy Operations that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues and all of the costs are allocated out so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed Given your present direction however you may be generating some margin in 2001 Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100 of your costs continue to be billed out or will some

again Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement but before we can go any further we need Ted s input He is now away for 2 1 2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front In the

RAC perspective Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding Others will also need to be consulted and I would like to agree a list of key people with you but I can t see their being any real contention Can you I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston and it may well be here too and this has been added to the outstanding list I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part

an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling All wholesale companies Enron Americas Enron Europe Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella In that organizational memo the Energy Operations team now Global Risk Management Operations was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services information technology and e commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well With this reorganization we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end I suggested that we wait until January 1 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works Senior management accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks Unfortunately however the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed To correct this effective April 01 2001 all EGM and EIM employees and non employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod respectively will be transferred to ENW Global Risk Management Operations under company 083E Starting April 1st you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes This will formalize the ENW Global Risk Management Operations structure There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over This applies only to the OASDI 6 2 which has a maximum wage base withholding of 80 400 00 for 2001 Medicare tax withholding of 1 45 has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding Therefore to alleviate the burden of starting over you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W 4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes You may also contact the Payroll Department 713 345 5555 to assist you with any questions We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams If you have questions please call the HR representative who supports your organization as identified below

transition etc Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date with e mails being sent from Bob Ball Enron to Steve Jackson AEP Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May He has worked with Enron s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement As of today Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron s Treasury group for her review Upon Mary s review Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you This new format incorporates the various memos and e mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues Items that

earlier this week for written protocol We will also update you weekly on the status of those e mails and or memos between ourselves and AEP I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly

staff meeting I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team From conversations that you and I have had I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager NomLogic Carrie Slagle Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger Integration Susan Harrison Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager ContactLogic Mary Solmonson Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member NomLogic Molly Sumrow Specialist User Requirement and Testing Staff Energy Operations Gas Schedulers Power Confirmation Team and Financial Settlements Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic NomLogic previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations ContactLogic global databases in Energy Operations Two of the Project Managers on the team Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business reporting to Brent Price Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people But knowing both Carrie and Susan well I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders Therefore identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team Molly Bob Hall our opeartions controller over natural gas suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions We called the project Contract Exchange and Bob Superty who is the daily manager over gas logistics was the project sponsor Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic Many of my key employees in gas scheduling confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well In the fall I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary s participation as a good way to leverage my time Previously she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic Unfortunately her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules Early in the project I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the CommodityLogic team Leslie Reeves who played a significant role in building Enron s power business from day one and Todd Hall with experience in natural gas and emerging products They were part of the CommodityLogic team in the early days and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic

couldn t meet this afternoon Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things Commercialization Efforts Services Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase Jennifer Denney who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group will partner with James Scribner in Mary s absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer They will welcome Rahil s help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model Commercialization Efforts Consulting Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort Bjorn s vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting consulting firm established marketing arm existing customer contacts proven consulting skills depth of resources etc There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us we impart our risk knowledge they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us we take our upfront payment they do most of the grinding work not necessarily a bad model Bjorn seems to be in a hurry as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way Prove concept and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else I spent some time with him today I want to be sure that he doesn t commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure We are okay for right now I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside I will keep you posted Commercialization Efforts Internal Marketing We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations Deal is in the works through power origination team they priced our services to customer without our involvement pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs We are researching To do s here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign off I met with Louise today on this I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19 Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams I will get you a draft for your comments Operational Risk Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland Have worked with Stacey White my power risk director and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan We lost the manager of that group last week a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland Operational Risk Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale This number was much larger earlier in the year around 70 but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue Operational Risk We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week This is the review of operational controls and procedures Went well Max was skeptical about the process at first but pleased in the end I will forward and e mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey He likes

Entelligence vs Global Counterparty Sally I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global Counterparty and in Global Companies Entelligence Much effort has been put forth in cleansing the parent subsidiary information presented in Entelligence yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except for on an ad hoc manual basis What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence Should changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein What process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for Entelligence As we struggle to report trading positions properly let s take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts Your

the standards Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year That will be a first to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global standards Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports Yes we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems For instance small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up These were on the side and not captured in total power exposure because they didn t have a book to put them in a discovery during the doorstep review If this goes on the exception report then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions we should get the appropriate attention to correct them The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception not in the books no confirm etc and was not included on the exception report that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these From David Port ENRON 11 10 2000 01 46 PM To Shona Wilson NA Enron Enron cc Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT Ted Murphy HOU ECT ECT Subject Fundamental Operating Standards This is the first time I have seen these have they been rolled out I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that attaches to these standards that you mentioned did you have anything particular in mind I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to which these standards are being adhered to see what you think Transactions are recorded accurately and timely completeness accuracy Daily report of holdovers by commodity group trades not booked in time for daily cut off including counterparty volume price etc Report of P L effect of booking errors as they transpire including responsibility Daily Management P L and Position reporting is accurate and timely completeness accuracy Periodic qualitative review by RAC i e Is it sufficient by reference to the Risk Management Policy does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure etc NB the point about Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially pre determined time conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy which says before any subsequent trading ocurrs I think the diagnostic measure should be for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final note I do not neccessarily mean officialized after the relevant market opening time usuaully 7 30 am Timely confirmation and execution of transactions completeness accuracy existence Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations outstanding inward confirmations i e sent out not signed outstanding outward confirmations i e deal done confirm not sent outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations showing deal trade date start date commodity counterparty MTM value aged Settlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely non CACS non Dashed deals Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash Unapplied cash by counterparty in original denomination including deal reference if any Unmatched amounts by deal where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM value One additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense so the obvious pitfalls of self assessment will come into play here Perhaps the pilot report should be put together

AM To Sally Beck HOU ECT ECT cc Subject FYI STP and T 1 Sally I went to a seminar on Monday evening organised by a consultancy called The Capital Markets Company who did the market analysis on the T 1 idea for the Global STP association Attendees were UBS Warburg Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Depository Trust Company etc The subject was nominally how moving to T 1 settlement in the financial markets would affect STP but it ended up going rather wider than that There were distinct echoes of some of the discussions at the ASE in Dallas so I thought you might be interested to see some of the thoughts expressed It seemed that every bank was hoping to be able to sell the back office services but no one seemed to be willing to buy Some people would only ever buy if there was more than one supplier so that there was a competitive market Somebody will eventually break through to be able to offer the services One cannot avoid having to understand processes by outsourcing one needs to understand the process in order to police the SLA Support personnel perceive that it will probably be 5 years before it becomes so difficult to make more more in the front office that there will be serious focus on saving money in the back office Nobody s compensation is realistically tied to achieving operational metrics Nothing will change until there is a crisis T 1 would just increase the number of fails this might be the crisis which would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining players would be only dealing with better organised counterparties which would decrease the number of fails This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle times reduced have

and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted I am sure After the two hour session it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth fulfilling IT s roles in some cases not communicating with the rest of my direct report team if your role is be a liaison then communication is a necessary component of the role struggling to create a role for themselves etc If my reaction had been to say what a talented group we have to figure out how to best utilize them then the outcome might have been different But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value that I couldn t in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation Sally Mike Jordan 02 27 2001 01 29 AM To Sally Beck

design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses EBS and EES will be included in 2001 The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test i e following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens Doing a deal test tells us what does happen And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens that we identify where operational and perhaps financial risk is created These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen As such they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA s reviews and to produce less paperwork It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk and the quick solutions to correct these that are valuable in these reviews These reviews also look for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems Briefly the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps 1 Cross functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office This is usually unannounced but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team s arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town 2 Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review 3 The review is conducted including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control operations personnel to understand the business processes The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions 4 The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed Potential action items are suggested This information is reviewed with the head of the office as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items knowing that with this focus he she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so 5 Starting late in 2000 the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me Ted s viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view Ted and I assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items Then on a quarterly basis Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter doorstep findings that had been handled updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter Through most of 2000 the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in 2000 We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron s practices Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well At my suggestion she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona relative to Rick Buy s e mail message Michael I understand that you may have felt blind sided by the e mail from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business And if that was the case I apologize for that While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shona s call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep team s concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick This meeting should have been with Ted and me In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick s about setting up a meeting Shona mentioned some concerns Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy We don t however control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react To reiterate the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization The key is quick discovery and quick resolution The findings create a dialogue between the business units RAC and Operations which I believe is healthy We purposefully have chosen not to over wordsmith the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews Frankly I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA s reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EEL s business Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process ","sender_address":"sally.beck@enron.com","message_id":"<72030.1075856076242.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_subject":"Doorstep Review

program but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around energy families in Oklahoma or Texas I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron Our first hire from OU and the top Energy Management student was Jody Crook He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation His first rotation has been on my

became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program OU transformed their old PLM Petroleum Land Management program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business This undergraduate degree retains the geology business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around energy families in Oklahoma or Texas I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron Our first hire from OU and the top Energy Management student was Jody Crook He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation His first rotation has been on my team working as a risk book administrator in gas trading He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team In addition to this last year s risk experience at Enron Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron I think very highly of him and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program His background and your business seem to be a good fit Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group

in this desig n 20 session This is a critical two day event to be held February 12th and 13t h 20 in Dallas Texas This work session is based on a unique approach called a 20 DesignShop 01v It is a very focused activity driven event that is compos ed of 20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups If you 20 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP you will likely 20 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous ly 20 experienced The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven 20 to be very successful Therefore we have elected to utilize this same 20 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending You were 20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th e 20 DesignShop You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as 20 little distraction or interruption as possible The quality of our results 20 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the 20 entire event Additionally you will be relied on in the future to suppor t 20 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session 20 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s o 20 that your participation can be maximized Therefore please make all 20 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during 20 these two days Please review the attached information regarding hotel flight information 20 and transportation

for the remainder of 2001 For Energy Operations that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues and all of the costs are allocated out so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed Given your present direction however you may be generating some margin in 2001 Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100 of your costs continue to be billed out or will some

again Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement but before we can go any further we need Ted s input He is now away for 2 1 2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put together I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC perspective Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding Others will also need to be consulted and I would like to agree a list of key people with you but I can t see their being any real contention Can you I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston and it may well be here too and this has been added to the outstanding list I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part

announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling All wholesale companies Enron Americas Enron Europe Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella In that organizational memo the Energy Operations team now Global Risk Management Operations was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services information technology and e commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well With this reorganization we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end I suggested that we wait until January 1 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works Senior management accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks Unfortunately however the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed To correct this effective April 01 2001 all EGM and EIM employees and non employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod respectively will be transferred to ENW Global Risk Management Operations under company 083E Starting April 1st you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes This will formalize the ENW Global Risk Management Operations structure There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over This applies only to the OASDI 6 2 which has a maximum wage base withholding of 80 400 00 for 2001 Medicare tax withholding of 1 45 has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding Therefore to alleviate the burden of starting over you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W 4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes You may also contact the Payroll Department 713 345 5555 to assist you with any questions We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams If you have questions please call the HR representative who

for her review Upon Mary s review Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you This new format incorporates the various memos and e mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues Items that only require actions by Enron will be our to do list Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and or their agreement via the e mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written protocol We will also update you weekly on the status of those e mails and or memos between ourselves and AEP I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale To provide clarity for these update meetings may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches 1 Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status or 2 I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week

CommodityLogic staff meeting I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team From conversations that you and I have had I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager NomLogic Carrie Slagle Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger Integration Susan Harrison Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager ContactLogic Mary Solmonson Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member NomLogic Molly Sumrow Specialist User Requirement and Testing Staff Energy Operations Gas Schedulers Power Confirmation Team and Financial Settlements Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic NomLogic previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations ContactLogic global databases in Energy Operations Two of the Project Managers on the team Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business reporting to Brent Price Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people But knowing both Carrie and Susan well I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders Therefore identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team Molly Bob Hall our opeartions controller over natural gas suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions We called the project Contract Exchange and Bob Superty who is the daily manager over gas logistics was the project sponsor Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic Many of my key employees in gas scheduling confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well In the fall I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary s participation as a good way to leverage my time Previously she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic Unfortunately her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules Early in the project I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the CommodityLogic team Leslie Reeves who played a significant role in building Enron s power business from day one and Todd Hall with experience in natural gas and emerging products They were part of the CommodityLogic team in the early days and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic

last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics and 183 without that Associate so I don t know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change 45 6 reduction At this moment I don t know how feasible that is But I will work with Jeff Stacey and Leslie to find out We need some questions answered first to go through this 1 Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics Together those groups represent 25 of the 184 headcount Going in I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions should be 21 reductions We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this Need names and weekend contact numbers 2 What will the overall headcount be for Netco What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes If commercial numbers don t change and the business scope doesn t change a 45 6 reduction is probably out of the question 3 Is the 100 number for Operations only a start up number Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up approval is obtained for physical gas business etc Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002 4 What are UBS expectations for mid and back office What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions One firm and I don t remember whether it was UBS or not mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in and would make a difference in staffing perhaps requiring more people We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required 5 Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction i e will we be coordinating and providing information to them or will UBS assume some of their functions This may impact our staffing needs What about consolidated risk reporting will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS We may have more questions but these are key now to get at a feasible number Sally

short last night but frankly I was in tears and it didn t make sense to continue the conversation Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel you should do what you think is best for you We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you My reaction last night was simply shock because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit And your lead in to the conversation with you know we are staying at a hotel was such a surprise Yes you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving but that was with Cindy Richard Brigeda Chris and Cara staying in our home as well With just the two of you and since you had said nothing to the contrary I assumed that you would be in our home What you couldn t know of course is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet a real bed instead of just a frame I ironed sheets on Sunday night something that I never do for us and have my framer on a tight turn around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room Certainly other guests can enjoy these things too but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel and again whatever is best for you Sounds as if we should make that the norm from this point forward and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday I am planning to take the day off from work and the plan was that David would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions David has taken some office space near Champions and we had planned to show you that as well Then we can rest you can to do that at the hotel if that is better for you before having our nails done at 4 00 But again whatever works best for you Just let us know Sally

fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit As you may know one o f our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mi d and back office services With the money and talent that has been poured into Enron s trading operations systems and processes we believed that th ere could be market demand for these services Ironically enough we had s ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic es on December 1 Understandably the customer became concerned during Nov ember and the deal was shelved Our experience was that there was much int erest in mid and back office services coupling our systems and our people but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr on that was offering these services The market place didn t want us to w in again as Enron 20 Obviously the world has changed While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts withi n EGM EIM EA EES etc I think that we would short change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s tage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate The idea wou ld be to form this services company with a consulting firm which could pro vide some capital additional resource pool and a ready sales channel Wit h the potential of spin off companies from Enron and with former Enron empl oyees taking jobs with other firms many doors would be opened for this in dependent services company to provide services Servicing the Enron Estat e could be the first engagement for this services company Depending upon the structure of the deal benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced co sts for systems and services perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of th e CommodityLogic tools the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements etc Another important aspect of this idea is that f or the systems and operations professionals this would create a true caree r opportunity a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm making it much more likely that these people could be retained 20 Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept There is definite interest so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today We a sked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems an d I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron s assets and our ho pe would be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted 20 The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dili gence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate s consid eration Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage I t would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal would there simply be an approval process with the Credit or s Committee and the Court Would there have to be some sort of open bid ding process on the proposal To set expectations within the consulting fi rm it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process 20 Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well

been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors Timing Through November backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st Testing Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished Telephones Only regular phones will be available For those with speed dial phones the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment Because the numbers change frequently we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number

risk is perhaps different from the impl ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels As on other policies devised by RAC it would seem that implement ation of

accurate a nd efficiently handled As you and I discussed this is a global effort spa nning all commodities all locations all source systems We have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope approach key milestones res ource requirements and projected timeline Project Greenlight A team of stakeholders from Operations IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina l input My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla n and timeline Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we review the details with you I think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the Wanda s list We can certainly update the cr oss functional team on efforts underway but there is no need for a new tea m to focus on this

consider in a cost per transaction mode I would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside red in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f ees Capital projects don t make sense on a cost per transaction basis s hould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon sor and ENW agree upon 20 While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction I still have concerns about this on a lot of levels Frankly the relationship be tween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E OL relationship If we are boxed into a cost per transaction then wheneve r John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho c analysis of P L we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric e accordingly Practically speaking there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn t needed yesterday and stopping to negotiate whether th e request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m e and my risk team fired I also have a big concern over pushing the envel ope on an arms length service arrangement I will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people The guys on my operations team honestly wor k every day with the business goals of EA in mind They work hard to insu re success for EA That is what John and Louise should want Push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don t have people fully ded icated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support It is kind of ironic I think that Enron is pleased with how I ve manage d operations and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su re that this works for Enron I have some really good people who are very motivated and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe d as an integral part of the team at EA EGM EIM etc We had to work har d to achieve that but we ve gotten there for the most part So how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut or to the success that we have had EES is reeling right now partly becaus e they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi ness in full And now I have been asked to help correct that Makes you k ind of wonder 20 I am fully supportive of running operations and ENW like a business with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively When I first took thi s role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir cumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi ce provider of choice A component of this is definitely striving for lowe r costs and higher value delivered We can continue to improve on this bu t going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron Sally 20
