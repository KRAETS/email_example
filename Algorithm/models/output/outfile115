constraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting David can follow up directly with me if that suits you 2 I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron s old trust document so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and can serve as a receptacle under the current plan Sending it out today 3 We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co executor and co trustees under your Will with Caron as back up to Debbie in that position However we are also going to create a generation skipping trust right away for Caron Who should be the initial trustee s of Caron s trust Debbie and MSDW or Randy and MSDW or even Caron and MSDW and who shoud be back up Caron and MSDW 4 You said that Debbie wants to name you as executor and trustee under her will Who should be your back up in those roles If Linda Wehring is Debbie s back up on Debbie s power of attorney I would suggest that she also be the back up executor trustee but Debbie may prefer to name Caron It would be best if Debbie would name at least two successors after you 1 Caron 2 Linda Wehring alternate That s it Please respond by whatever mode you prefer I hope email is reasonably satisfactory for purposes of my asking these questions I tend to start with email because it is so non obtrusive but I m happy to do whatever you prefer SD
