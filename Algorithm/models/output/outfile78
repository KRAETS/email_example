Sorry about the way I left last night but I needed to leave abruptly or I felt I would have lost it even more You are right This is a very difficult time in my life However I want you to know that you are a very special person to me The more I get to know you the more I realize that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it off so well so very quickly I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you but right now there is just too much anger mistrust and hurt in my emotions to allow that All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have imagined These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you likely don t understand it all fully I am not sure I understand it fully I fear I am making a big mistake because I know you won t be available long You have so much to offer beautiful intelligent funny and someone who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship All of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we orginally met When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions I freaked out because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to realize that I would hurt you So I completely pulled back thinking I should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future Believe me it is not easy to stay away from you because even though we have only known each other a short time I miss you and think about you a lot It would be hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night My kidding you about Lee I will have to admit also shows my insecurity about that Mexico was so wonderful because except for that one night I was able to put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you I think that is why we had such a great time Cynthia when we were together on that trip I felt a lightness that I haven t felt in a long time You looked so beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar and it was all about us and nothing else I have been through it enough to know that

Coens hit most notes in Brother O Brother Where Art Thou Southern comedy drama color PG 13 1 46 By Todd McCarthy Daily Variety Chief Film Critic CANNES Variety A musically tinged riff on The Odyssey set in the Depression era Deep South O Brother Where Art Thou is a charming if lightweight Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial cumulative impact which will likely translate into just OK box office results come domestic release in the fall While the film s epigraph and inspiration come from Homer its title derives from Preston Sturges film biz classic Sullivan s Travels in which the successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called O Brother Where Art Thou Despite appropriating the handle the Coens aren t about to fall into the trap of pretentiousness themselves crafting instead a seriocomedy that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals with the leader Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney telling his cronies Pete John Turturro and Delmar Tim Blake Nelson that he knows where 1 2 million is buried The first person they encounter however a blind black man driving a railway handcar warns them that they will find treasure out there but not the treasure they re seeking A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology It s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart he advises Everett stands by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism Picking up a young black musician Tommy Johnson Chris Thomas King on the road the fellows wander into an isolated radio station recording studio and posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys cut a lively tune and are paid a few bills for their efforts They then take off again and remain oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the lushly verdant landscapes which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in slightly washed out and burnished hues that are a constant delight They hook up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson a wonderfully live wired Michael Badalucco who hates his nickname Babyface and goes into a huge post crime funk In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of visuals performance and music the boys come upon three sirens who seduce them in a watery glade when Pete disappears thereafter the dense Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad which he proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory one eyed salesman for the word of God a Cyclops like John Goodman squeezes the critter to death while beating the other two silly Pete eventually turns up again only to become perturbed when Everett reveals that his real goal rather than the nonexistent treasure is to reunite with the mother of his seven daughters Penny Holly Hunter who is about to marry another fellow In the course of things the errant adventurers brush up against local politics a governor s race that pits old incumbent Pappy O Daniel Charles Durning against a reform candidate whose motto Friend of the Little Man is literally represented by a broom toting dwarf who accompanies him at every campaign stop After slipping in a quiet homage to Sullivan s Travels in which members of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a picture show the Coens deliver one of their major set pieces a stupendously choreographed Ku Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes the invasion of the Wicked Witch s castle by Dorothy s friends in The Wizard of Oz Raucous the devil gets his due musical climax is fun and given a big charge by Durning in a splendid performance capping turn but is also rather too fairy tale ish and too good to be true to truly satisfy leaving this an Odyssey without full closure Lack of irony and complexity in the wrap up may be a shortcoming but it also points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the film s portrait of dimwits con men rednecks and country folk Most of the characters including the three leads may be dumb misguided and delusional but they are also engaging and straightforward to be enjoyed for the colorful oddballs that they are Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everett s vanity and in delivering the Coens carefully calibrated high toned dialogue Turturro and Nelson a character actor who directed the 1997 indie Eye of God and the upcoming Othello update O are a real dumb and dumber combo without veering into slapstick while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness from Durning and well known regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root as the blind recording entrepreneur musician King as the boys sometime collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the escapees to the bitter end Not as elaborate as The Hudsucker Proxy or The Big Lebowski pic is nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins splendid camerawork blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassner s evocative production design Mary Zophres imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are all but imperceptible as such watch for that cow Delta blues music a combo of T Bone Burnett and pre existing tunes is another major plus Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney Pete John Turturro Delmar Tim

Gathering Agreement","message_mailbox":"nemec-g","message_body":"Dan I have reviewed the Wildhorse Mesa Gathering Processing and Transport Agreement This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated to this Agreement through 2013 The agreement present some problematic issues which I will outline 1 Gas Quality The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers in this case Northwest Pipeline gas quality specifications We propose to put in a treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications however there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse Wildhorse could delay are extract value from us for this connection This is an uncertainty 2 Wildhorse Obligation to Perform Based on my understanding of the facts at some point during the term of this agreement Northwest Pipeline enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the downstream side of Wildhorse s Gathering System As a result Wildhorse shut in Enogex s production and it has been shut in ever since Wildhorse has a right to do this under this Agreement see 1 above and therefore Wildhorse has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement Wildhorse s obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the gas 3 Unprofitability Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications they could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was still uneconomical for them to do so If they decided it is uneconomical for them to do so they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential solutions which include i renegotiating the terms ii allowing Enogex to operate Wildhorse s equipment at Enogex sole cost expense and risk or iii release the gas from the Agreement The problem here is that there is no time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no specific solution they must reach Wildhorse could drag this out for some extended period of time and they could extract significant value My recommendation is that we make Enogex s resolution of these issues with Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal I know the timing is late However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the gas everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions ","sent_time":"2000-06-28 10:05:00-07:00","received_time":"2000-06-28

Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota production is committed Please review and provide comments To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement 1 Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday Brett also forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse The correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse No demands were made by Enogex and no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse Brett stated that the Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications Enogex took Wildhorse s word for that and never checked with Northwest or Questar I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release the gas He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse 2 I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa Nothing really useful There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought these assets were in a state of economic viability decline Unfortunately this letter was not directed to Enogex However the draft letter takes that position with Wildhorse 3 I am securing local consul out of Denver I want someone intimately familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective to be involved We may need to seek a declaratory order We have run into to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown Should have this resolved on Monday 4 Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas However to reiterate based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement The fact that the Entrada Gas is not in spec with the downstream pipelines for inerts allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in

Gerald I have provided a few coments redlined to your draft letter attached below However I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter A Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the shut in status of Entrada production Should we request written notification related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production As we ve discussed Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse so we do not have any historic documentation of Wildhorse s claims B Should we identify potential contractual issues due to the curtailment of Dakota production e g Sec 6 detailing the wellhead delivery pressure requirements under this contract et al As we ve discussed the system pressures have increased due to initially gas being re routed by Wildhorse over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system and now the NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased pressures system wide If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these problems to persist by referring to Sec 7 Gas Quality of the agreement what remedies can we request partial release of Dakota gas Here s the frustration based on conversations with producers in the area and the documents we ve received from Enogex Wildhorse has continued to attach non pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to increase gathering revenues yet has not invested any for processing of this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines Then they use the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive producers and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and quality issues discussed above Therefore its critical that this letter gets to the right people within Wildhorse and if possible make reference to some element of timing e g reasonable dispatch commercially reasonable manner etc

Summary of Tom Brown Meeting","message_mailbox":"nemec-g","message_body":"Confidential Work Product Attorney Client Privilege Dan Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution As the situation stands now Wildhorse s possible responses to the letter are as follows 1 Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment If they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo one of which is release of the gas You are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives That is a risk I pointed out early However in our letter to Wildhorse I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice A Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract This will take time Depending on court docket loads 6 months to 1 year B Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by Wildhorse and that we will build our own system Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse 2 Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms The only complication is that under the contract Wildhorse s obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream Depending on Wildhorse s flow dynamics and our plant placement Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas After your field meeting and our engineering assessment hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal I would very directly ask them under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees They don t have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability Dan J Bump ENRON 08 01 2000 05 23 PM To Gerald Nemec HOU ECT ECT cc Scott Josey Corp Enron ENRON Brian Redmond HOU ECT ECT Joan Quick HOU ECT ECT Subject Summary of Tom Brown Meeting I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today I met with the Business Development Director Bob Mustard 1 Tom Brown as 45 owner of Wildhorse is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems quality pressure et al currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin 2 Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo and other producers low Btu gas they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse 3 Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology I passed all this info on to Ken Jim 4 Here s the interesting part Bob discussed confidentially that for the past 6 8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy out of Kinder Morgan s interest in Wildhorse they have a right to match provision in their LLC agreement The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt Kinder Evans If they are successful which he thinks TBI will be then TBI will turn around and look to spin off the non strategic systems like the Piceance Basin assets to third party purchasers This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with Wildhorse Wildhorse has been slow playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and 4 above may be the reason why Now that we ve sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting essentially to clarify their understanding status of the contracts so we can get to work my feeling based on the transaction between KMI TBI is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete how much longer will this take Of course if the transaction is completed TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system so even if ENA is interested will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested The point is this I m anticipating a generic non commital response to Crescendo s letter from Wildhorse Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out I m off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse I ll keep you informed of any developments Thanks Dan ","sent_time":"2000-08-02 07:07:00-07:00","received_time":"2000-08-02

couple hundred of us We re hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 12 25 In the

songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1 30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 1 47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he s so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non refundable non transferrable sons of bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non refundable and non transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre game kingdom 2 34 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 2 45 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 3 01 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas I m still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 3 36 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 3 56 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 4 11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 4 21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 4 51 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 5 18 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 5 27 I call Southwest Airlines I m sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non refundable and non transferrable 5 37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didn t you announce last call over the fucking PA system 5 49 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo the Texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up he empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 6 16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 6 30 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the basketball game 8 00 Texas Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I don t care 7 12 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima I ve never had a Zima I wonder if it s any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 7 17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I don t care 8 01 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides You re Going to Miss Me When I m Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 8 30 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him he s an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think he s still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 8 47 I am

giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 9 41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to

down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 9 52 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 10 09 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if I m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 10 15 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself I m taking this a bit seriously 10 22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing I m so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 10 43 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and

meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to be grateful for that gift When the door of happiness closes another opens but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don t see the one which has been opened for us The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ve ever had It s true that we don t know what we ve got until we lose it but it s also true that we don t know what we ve been missing until it arrives Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they ll love you back Don t expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn t be content it grew in yours It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone Don t go for looks they can deceive Don t go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright Find the one that makes your heart smile There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real Dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do May you have enough happiness to make you sweet enough trials to make you strong enough sorrow to keep you human enough hope to make you happy Always

everything that comes along their way Happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives Love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can t go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches When you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling Live your life so that when you die you re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying Please send this message to those people who mean something to you to those who have touched your life in one way or another to those who make you smile when you really need it to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship And if you don t don t worry nothing bad will happen to you you

Pipeline Precedent Agreement As part of Enron s acquisition of the wholesale unit of Columbia Energy Services Enron North America has a Precedent Agreement with the Millennium Pipeline project The Precedent Agreement contains termination clauses that are date certain for January 14 2000 These clauses have been extended numerous times in the past The PA also contains a clause that gives Enron the right to terminate the agreement if FERC s Order regarding Millennium s Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Enron The FERC has not acted upon Millennium s Certificate Application The PA also includes an exclusivity clause Section 3 4 that we would like clarified in conjunction with extending the dates in the agreement Millennium would like to clarify the exclusivity clause in an interpretive letter rather than eliminate the language from the PA Millennium claims that if they eliminate the language for Enron they would have to do the same for other shippers Therefore we would like to remove the ambiguity of the exclusivity clause and clarify Enron s rights through the interpretive letter If we cannot agree on the interpretive letter language then we can still exercise the right to terminate the PA by deeming the FERC Order unacceptable The following is the language of the exclusivity clause a rough cut that I have made for language in the interpretive letter and the clause pertaining to the FERC Order Could you please give me your thoughts on the interpretive letter We can then send the letter to the pipeline for signature by both Enron North America and Millennium Exclusivity Clause Section 3 4 This Agreement shall constitute the exclusive agreement by which Shipper shall seek to obtain a firm natural gas transportation service with respect to Shipper s MDQ except for agreements pursuant to which Shipper contracts for the transportation of its MDQ to and from the Millennium Project Interpretive Letter Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3 4 of the Millennium Pipeline Project Precedent Agreement between the sponsors of the Millennium Pipeline Project and Enron North America Shipper as successor to Columbia Energy Services Shipper is not precluded from obtaining firm or interruptible natural gas transportation services on any interstate pipeline offering services similar to the Millennium Pipeline FERC Order Clause Section 5 1 If the FERC s order regarding Millennium s Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Shipper in its sole discretion then Shipper may terminate this Agreement by giving Millennium notice thereof within fifteen 15 days after the date of issuance of the FERC s order In the event that Millennium fails to receive approval of this Agreement from its Management Committee to the extent required Millennium may terminate this Agreement by giving Shipper fifteen 15 days prior notice ","sent_time":"2000-01-12

Yahoo News Aggies are getting themselves into trouble again AP A Texas A M University student who claimed he had been raped by a dog was yesterday jailed for 12 months Martin Hoyle 20 was arrested by police after the passengers of a passing car witnessed a Bull Terrier called Badger having sex with Hoyle on the side of Highway 290 just north of Hempstead Assistent District attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers of the car an unidentified couple from Houston had stopped to help because they thought Hoyle was being attacked by the animal But when they got closer they saw that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles was down on all fours and the dog was straddling him from behind The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken a liking to him said Mr Crossland The couple were extremely offended and sickened by what they saw Another individual in a passing car contacted police on a cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog on the feeder road Hoyle of College Station told police I can t help it if the dog took a liking to me He tried to rape me He repeated the rape allegation at the police station and added The dog pulled my jeans down Hoyle who has been arrested several times on alcohol related charges was jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act that outraged public decency His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incident because of his intoxicated state but was now very remorseful and incredibly embarrassed Jailing him Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle Never before in my time at the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public highway Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension It is an absolutely disgusting thing for members
