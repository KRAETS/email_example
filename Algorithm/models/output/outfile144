to mind I had trouble with my email from home Let me know what else I need to do Thanks DG I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities assets supply contracts transportation contracts and storage contracts and then became responsible for providing 100 of the gas requirements of BUG I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group our logistics group our risk management group and gas accounting group In addition I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues It was a 24MM Year deal I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal I also created invoice models I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues This office made 12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a 10MM flash to actual variance in the region Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P L and the GL Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem After managing the desk for 6 months I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one saving the company approx 100K Year

is just a better quality product than Kenwood thus the price discrepancy I and this is just me would not buy a Kenwood I would buy Onkyo Denon Yamaha or Harman Kardon These are more expensive but I think better than Sony Kenwood JVC Technics and Pioneer The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price The sites I would check out are onecall com soundcity com jandr com hifi com You also need to look at audioreview com You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased It is a great site They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid On those sites to buy that I mentioned you need to call and talk to someone They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet Give me a call 713 853
