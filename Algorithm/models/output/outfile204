What type of insulation in floors and ceiling Batts or blown Fiberglass or Cellulose 5 Any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine 6 Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides I didn t know the difference between an apron and a stool 7 Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking Double plywood or hardi board underlay 8 On the stairs did you allow for a bannister I was thinking a partial one out of iron Only about 5 feet 9 I did not label it on the plan but I was intending for a 1 2 bath under the stairs A pedestal sink would probably work 10 Are undermount sinks different than drop ins I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths 11 1 or 2 A C units I am assuming 2 12 Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors 13 No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets 14 Exterior porches included in bid Cedar decking on upstairs Iron railings 15 What type of construction contract would you use Fixed price except for change orders I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start I think I am ready to get plans drawn up I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas Phillip I ","message_mailbox":"allen-p","sender_address":"phillip.allen@enron.com"},{"received_time":"2001-03-28

The Kansas City Star Date 01 20 01 22 15 As natural gas prices rose in December traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the forecast was for frigid weather Traders put the two together anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights Traders do that all the time they re looking forward said William Burson a trader It makes the market for natural gas But the market s response perplexed Chris McGill the American Gas Association s director of gas supply and transportation He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994 and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality It s a little frustrating that they don t take the time to understand what we are reporting McGill said As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills the hunt for reasons and culprits is on Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street Stephen Adik senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market s speculators for the rise in gas prices It s my firm belief that today s gas prices are being manipulated Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly In California where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis six investigations are looking into the power industry Closer to home observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter s startling gas bills having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes Most utilities often with the acquiescence of regulators failed to take precautions such as fixed rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared We re passing on our gas costs which we have no control over said Paul Snider a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers There s been a failure of risk management by utilities and that needs to change said Ed Krapels director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc an energy consulting firm in Wakefield Mass Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain Their heating bills are up sharply In many circles little else is discussed The Rev Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a 1 456 December bill for heating the church more than double the previous December s bill Church members are suffering from higher bills as well The Sunday collection is down said Fraser who might have to forgo part of his salary For the first time the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating It s the talk of the town here he said A year ago that wasn t a fear Wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn t make it worthwhile to drill for gas Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers But trouble was brewing By spring gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand cubic feet just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter There was a dip in the fall but then prices rebounded By early November prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher But 10 gas was coming Below normal temperatures hit much of the country including the Kansas City area and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets It s all about the weather said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis Wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet led by the New York traders Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price volatile commodity in the world Setting the price In the 1980s the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas allowing it to float In 1990 the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce And big gas consumers from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas But if they get on the right side of a price trend traders don t need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they re trading Like all futures the gas contracts are purchased on credit That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time As December began the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than 7 per thousand cubic feet By the end of the month it was nearly 10 Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association s weekly storage numbers Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter Going into the winter the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing in hopes that the summer s unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop Still the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient But when below normal temperatures arrived in November the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994 Still said the association s McGill there was sufficient gas in storage But some utility executives didn t share that view William Eliason vice president of Kansas Gas Service said that if December s cold snap had continued into January there could have been a real problem meeting demand I was getting worried he said Then suddenly the market turned when January s weather turned warmer Wednesday s storage numbers were better than expected and futures prices dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers Among area utilities Kansas Gas Service increased its customers cost of gas charge earlier this month to 8 68 per thousand cubic feet And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to 9 81 to begin Wednesday Sheila Lumpe chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level payment plan and to conserve energy Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place which is expected to save an average customer about 25 this winter Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs On Friday Doug Micheel senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy s gas purchasing practices Consumers are taking all the risk Micheel said It s

here are a few ideas 1 Fixed construction profit of 1 4 million Builder doesn t benefit from higher cost rather suffers as an equity holder 2 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51 sq ft phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60 40 but could be as favorable as 55 45 I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon Feel free to call me at home 713 463 8626 Phillip

sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail If you need to call with questions my home number is 713 463 8626 As far as recommendations here is a short list 1 Examine LDC s incentive rate program Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost The result is that the LDC s sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index This creates a shortage in later months 2 California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand Investigate why it wasn t maximized operationally Specific questions should include 1 Why in March 00 May 00 weren t total system receipts higher in order to fill storage 2 Why are there so many examples of OFO s on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal s system I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity but injected far less 3 Similar to the power market there is too much benchmarking to short term prices Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs By design the customers

discussed yesterday I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 4 70 4 80 for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index At the time of these trades offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation Additionally these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27 These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online EOL Enron s direct phone conversations and three brokerage firms Amerex APB and Prebon Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships The two key points from this data are as follows 1 The high physical prices on the 26th 27th 4 75 4 80 are much greater than the high financial trades 4 6375 4 665 on those days 2 The spread relationship between San Juan and other points Socal Northwest is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily It doesn t make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers Hopefully the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4 70 s and these trades are outliers I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index It is Enron s belief that the trades at 4 70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal Sincerely Phillip Allen ","message_mailbox":"allen-p","sender_address":"phillip.allen@enron.com"},{"received_time":"2000-08-09
