wasn t here Friday I was really nervous coming in But I think it s ok for now They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor or what is left of it They ll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything Honestly I think that is llikely to happen It s just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1 4 Ouch
