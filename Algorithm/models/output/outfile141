I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions starting September 14th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is non existent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the protocols So the OOMC OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the spirit of the OOM s as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC means run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to run by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three e mails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding this issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot s intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we would receive as little as 1 for electricity that cost 27 to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someone else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and non spinning Ercot s interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OOME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagreement This could very well be a 500 000 issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for 27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at 5 in hopes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comment Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in response to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect Section 5 4 4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME deployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a software issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled Once we have been OOMC d we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would request to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic environment to generate for 27 and sell for 5 Further operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney 37160

you let s talk about me the Entergy gig was made more difficult as I received NO training in cash trading After a couple of months a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging which is

have lost the first part of this year as I was training myself There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what s right for both E and myself To that end Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron s assets in Texas learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert Smith Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need while they get my experience in Services training managing a team and making money in a pool type market as exists in Texas These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland I would still like to live in Portland as early as February I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone and I will revisit this issue in Feb This compromise seems reasonable I have asked that this be committed to writing so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities Additionally most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the back corner The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone and they will make their money with or without help A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him then he has them sent home I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now One or two will be paid for two years or so I m told This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors but I will not be any part of it I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture If we dont get buy in from the top I will also be at risk of going home Some of these guys just dont get it There are however many positives to staying here the guys I report to are like minded concerning the above They are very competent and have a lot to teach they are willing to teach I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team Well thanks for listening to my sermon

s and zero premium because the unit was offline In the Resource Plan we can attach a premium for OOM up or down In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was unavailable and offline The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot this cannot be completed by the QSE Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to We called Jerry Watson with Frontera and he relayed that this was possible Ercot immediately OOM d us up 135 mw s beginning hour ending 13 to control congestion They later upped this to 185 mw s for the remainder of the day through 2400 I called Mark Patterson who is our Ercot Rep and I explained the situation I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline I also wanted to know how this would settle His reply is as follows Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant that changed our status from unavailable to available Since we had an implied low premium zero on our plant we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated The mcp was low all day mid teens yesterday If we had been OOM d up and could not recover our startup gen costs we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover at most our costs We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw s available with a 50 premium This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6 8 2 2 Please review this to understand why this applies This was a very educational process We think that in revising our Resource Plan on the fly we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera Until further notice the following policy should be implemented If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability Say the unit is NOT available If Frontera is scheduled to run need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums 50 premium for OOM up 10 premium for OOM down These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order If we are OOM d up the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked If we are OOM d down then we should be paid the mcp premium Please call me if you have

asked them whether they mean OOME when we run To a man the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run they want the power I have launched three e mails requesting clarification to Mark Patterson starting weeks ago on this issue Yesterday I caught Mark by phone at 5 30pm Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC d and we should run but they are not going to pay us the hr calc They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance instead of the heat rate calc We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than 5 It costs us 26 to generate power Mark said dont worry at worst case you can file for reimbursement Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity But what It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue They want to penalize us if we dont run and if we do we will lose money We then file to get a break even rebate They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples as requested by Ercot I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions I do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore We will be more vocal in this meeting If

proposed selling 12 7 heat rate in September They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market This didnt work out On a daily basis Frontera has a problem making timely decisions For example I give them gas prices and daily prices They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day I tell them that I will bookout my option They call back later and say that they would like to run Bids are now 2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible On Tuesday I suggested selling a 24 call option for October for a 1 25 premium This would have at least brought in 23 000 They werent interested in this idea I communicate my feelings on the market very early If they could react quicker I would smack the first bids that showed their faces including EOL I could have taken out 200mw s in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay He will

flexibilty and decision making responsibility This will make more sense once you inherit the position The following positions need to be watched for monday 1 We are short to Mirant on behalf of Frontera for hour ending 6 only We need to buy 50 mw s and schedule this with Mirant Real Time They are expecting and have agreed to this trade This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis If you are working Sunday night check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade It is very common that they get a bad handoff and are unaware of this transaction Give them plenty of time to work this out We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X and a sale to Mirant In Enpower buy from X and sell to Frontera under the Teco Services book Enter this as a flat transaction ie buy for 20 and sell to Frontera for 20 2 The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw s for offpeak Monday at 11 25 Sell this or leave to the pool as necessary I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10 16 19 I think that Saturday morning will come in strong as we are getting some cooler weather I think also that some larger units are coming off line which will put upward pressure on the offpeak Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want Next day onpeak is trading for 20 5 offpeak is trading 11 25 Where is the value Lets trade it up JMF
