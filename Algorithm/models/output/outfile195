financial trade but a physical trade I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn t know about the trade until yesterday The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened She said she didn t know but would check into it She left me a message yesterday evening
