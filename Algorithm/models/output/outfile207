they said 3 bcf by dec ill let you know its been along week weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me i know this isnt same as crude less mature but getting there so im always wondering if when the mentality will start to go more that way ie inverses shud be for only 1 reason that supply demand balance will get less tite than it is today some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk too they still in im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds and 30 cts inverses will be hard to maintain unless we have crazy weather we re only 2 weeks from withdrawel period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds until all the length bails your rite on the mkt the anticipation is in the mkt you gotta have flat px to make money my approach in the short term as well that said everyone at pira including pira all bull bull the winter will be good i think for a win sum01 win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap fyi pira also bearish crude not saying they rite but will have impact on natgas producers sentiment short term esp as mideast starts to fiad for you be careful of the politics effecting heating oil natgas watching too there will be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs negatively and therefore may roll to natgas ie if ho goes a big discount to natgas before any major cold gas will get hit i think if i hear anything on oil side ill be happy to pass it on apprec comment on producers not that im surpirsed wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks getting hit lately good luck man talk soon pira was good you go next year ill set up you some interesting people good to network cuz we never know where we ll end up by the way you bullish sum 02 win 02 or are you rolling a short non of my biz but i was on the other side ill add if it narrows more inkjections next summer will be huge albeit from low stx curve will mean revert eventually ","message_id":"<22971590.1075857587764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"received_time":"2000-10-17

in class today We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May s VaR It looks as if during the month of June the book administor loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID s the code is NG OPT XL PRC For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June June 1st 797 million dollars loss June 2nd 192 million dollars made June 5th 300 million dollars made etc This problem makes it impossible to backtest Second regarding a different approach the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional 5 million dollars of VaR thereby temporarily increasing your limit to 45 million This limit increase is in effect until July 26th The game plan is that during this time period a better solution can be devised I hope this helps Thanks Frank John

professional relationship He is an extremely creative individual Whalley actually commented on him today as someone who thinks outside the box Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron He throws out ideas and every once in a while he comes up with a great one He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market a market I normally don t follow closely that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron In return I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk reward trades for someone with finite capital I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades Having said that we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC s Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non investment grade counterparty I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded He was absolutely right about the valuation and we on the trading desk knew it as well There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations This was one product Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don t take into account gas fundamental price limitations For instance it is less probable though not impossible for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used Obviously we have this function in our pricing models I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models This has since been changed Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non investment grade companies trade these types of products Finally on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances If you believe differently please advise Thanks

Under the 9 dollar test not only were the price curves shifted but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100 and all other vol locations being raised accordingly Key findings include 7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79 9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134 It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress VaR on the financial desk actually decreased This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike the financial desk is long gamma which overall reduces risk But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike it appears that the desk becomes short gamma thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74 Does this make sense or is something else happening Frank

to 12 hours We want the orders open as long as possible Now it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour Traditionally limit orders are a day order good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise 2 Today Pete had 13 000 day on his bid because he was hit for small size When I tried to place a limit order the quantity had to be in 5 000 increments of 13 000 i e

two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David Forster ENRON enronXgate on 05 08 2001 09 55 AM To John Arnold HOU ECT ECT cc Savita Puthigai ENRON enronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out of hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables Intensity Speed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases I ll call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision making program will need to work with several criteria inputs definitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be 4 Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be 0 3 If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be 1 Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be 0 3 If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be equal to 1 Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be 0 04 Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be 0 50 Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be 0 Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be 0 50 Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started Spread Offset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be 0 01 Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be 240 seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user defined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the user defined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity 240 and Buys Buys TRR and Sells Sells TRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the user defined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread Offset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread Offset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread Offset Minimum GUI Formulas Example Constants Intensity Factor 4 Dead Interval 240 Offset Reversion Ratio ORR 0 3 Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR 0 3 Spread Minimum 0 04 Spread Maximum 0 50 Offset Minimum 0 Offset Maximum 0 49 Spread Offset Minimum 0 01 INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula

rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks e g gas is trading at 5 50 The notification levels could be 8 at the top end and 2 at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

making provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN the American Community Network AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate It is your call as to which approach works best for you Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven t received the consideration they deserve The standards are a great way to tell their story If you d like more information on the use of the standards look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC s National Seminars on

about how to address the ICE issue His thoughts are that if we are 4 5 on EOL we post 1 8 on ICE If someone betters the bid to 1 5 a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1 75 If someone betters that to 2 bid we immediately go 2 25 bid So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2 way Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3 75 5 25 at which point our 4 5 market gets shown If the 3 75 bid pulls out so does our 4 bid Our proposal was that if EOL was 4 5 we would always show ICE 3 75 5 25 Think about which system you like better Whalley loved Fletch s idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor

opinion is that anything under 2 7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter A month ago analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2 6 2 7 in the ground With the most recent AGA those projections seem to be closer to 2 7 With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term you must look at the demand side of the equation The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching such that supplies will be stored rather than burned Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter A low AGA number indicates we haven t priced out enough demand and the market must go up Certainly the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument but the number may be a function of very mild weather a four day holiday weekend and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift

percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0 40 The second quarter 2000 results exclude 0 13 per share of one time merger related items Diluted average common shares

compared with 263 million in the year ago period EBIT from the company s non regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to 246 million and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non regulated segments produced these record results said William A Wise president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation Reflecting our long standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets Merchant Energy s earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter For the first six months of 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to 1 40 per share compared with 0 76 for the first six months of 1999 Consolidated EBIT for the six months excluding non recurring items increased 55 percent to 798 million compared with 515 million in the year ago period Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of 152 million in the second quarter 2000 compared with 6 million in the same period last year and 50 million in the first quarter 2000 The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions continued strong wholesale customer business and management fees from Project Electron the company s off balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments all contributed to the record second quarter performance The Production segment reported a 30 percent increase in second quarter EBIT to 52 million compared with 40 million a year ago reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999 Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were 2 26 per million cubic feet MMcf of natural gas and 19 21 per barrel of oil up 12 percent and 29 percent respectively from the year ago levels Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14 275 barrels per day The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of 30 million nearly double an adjusted 16 million in 1999 The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000 Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4 1 trillion Btu per day TBtu d while processing volumes averaged 1 1 TBtu d Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of 190 million compared with an adjusted 187 million a year ago reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger Overall system throughput averaged 11 3 TBtu d During the quarter Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of 12 million compared with 16 million in 1999 Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company s investment in the Philippines Telecom Update We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business El Paso Global Networks said

storage book as of 5 25 and 5 26 where we had some counterintuitive results This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process It seems that the problem arises from forward forward vols used by the VaR system You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR on a cumulative basis jumps on Jan 04 when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in VaR This row Jan 04 is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet Please look at column D The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors a a bug in the code We are working with the person in IT who wrote the code to review it b a poorly conditioned forward vol curve a kink or discontinuity in the fwd vol curve will do it One solution I can propose is to develop for the traders a fwd fwd vol generator allowing them to review the fwd vol curve before it is posted If it produces a weird fwd fwd vol it can be smoothed Can you meet at 4 p m to review our findings Vince ","message_id":"<9106038.1075857593234.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"received_time":"2000-06-01

adequate size on the options Optimally I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes If the swap is 4 4 5 one a day up and someone buys half a day making the market 4 4 5 one a day by half a day the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts a much smaller size than most people want to trade If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4 4 5 one a day by half a day the input into the option calculator is 3 75 4 75 100 up In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest we must continue to support it Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves In terms of straddle strikes I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off Although striking on the mid market is probably easier for the trader I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200 they have to call ENE to close the trade If the trade is struck at 3100 we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times Secondly I would anticipate non volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction

the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals There are convincing arguments as to why the summer winter spreads should tighten over time However in the previous methodology they blew out For instance summer winter in Cal 3 was 232 while Cal 10 was 256 I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year These premiums are as follows Jan 008 Feb 004 Mar 001 Apr 002 May 003 Jun 004 Jul 004 Aug 004 Sep 003 Oct 002 Nov 003 Dec 006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2 959 the 3 4

jarnold enron com cc Subject try this one Please read the following problem very carefully and write in a number at the end You should be ready to defend your answer Only a number is allowed not an algebraic equation Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A the acquirer which is currently considering acquiring Company T the target by means of a tender offer You plan to tender in cash for 100 of Company T s shares but are unsure how high a price to offer The main complication is this the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking Indeed the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome If the project fails the company under current management will be worth nothing 0 share But if the project succeeds the value of the company under current management could be as high as 100 share All share values between 0 and 100 are considered equally likely By all estimates the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management In fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T If the project fails the company is worth 0 share under either management If the exploration project generates a 50 share value under current management the value under Company A is 75 share Similarly a 100 share value under Company T implies a 150 share value under Company A and so on The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T s shares This offer must be made now before the outcome of the drilling project is known From all indications Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A provided it is at a profitable price Moreover Company T wishes to avoid at all cost the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press Thus you Company A will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer In addition Company T will accept any offer by Company A that

do the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model in my mind there are three big reasons for skew one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment however moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium supports a vol smile theory in addition in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level nat gas historically is more volatile at 5 than at 4 and more volatile at 4 than 3 thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market to test regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation second reason is heptocurtosis fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts supports vol smile theory easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution third is just supply and demand in a market where spec players are bearish put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book if you have a neutral view towards market or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way producer fences if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are can be profitable to take other side of trade if you want to discuss further give me a call 4 6 pm houston time hope this helps john

months We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid offer regardless of whose it is In this framework Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system However we would hold the book getting to see what everyone was doing at all times The idea is that if we can move the industry s order flow from 30 40 EOL to 60 EOL we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors Still working on technical issues The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis Give me a call if you want to discuss Andrew Fairley 03 13 2001 11 14 AM To John Arnold HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Re Trip to Houston John Redmond I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas We have managed to double our average daily volumes and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market We estimate 50 now Spectron are getting about 20 30 of the number of trades we do There are still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing As far as we are concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are executing the strategy you mentioned below Once again thanks for your help All the best Andy John Arnold 21 02 2001 04 26 To Andrew Fairley LON ECT ECT cc Subject Re Trip to Houston Andy Enjoyed meeting with you One more thing I did not address My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL However in addition to the NYMEX we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems We make it a point to never support these if possible We will only trade if the other system s offer is at or greater than our bid For instance if we are 6 8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7 I will simultaneously lift their 7 s and move my market to 7 9 The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I m bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off If they don t post numbers on the other systems the systems get no liquidity and die I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron s system I don t know whether it is in regards to gas power or metals Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders John Andrew Fairley 02 20 2001

07 2001 08 55 AM To John Arnold HOU ECT ECT cc Subject rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas Disagree about the demand destruction I think some demand is just permanently gone i 3 cheaper BTUs in ASIA Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health energy demand is changing Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley I think we don t have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are So what i m saying is that industrial demand will weaken demand in service based industries will increase Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries Also I think in 2000 people had sticker shock they couldn t have imagined 10 gas but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds they will find ways of running their factories Also they will budget for these prices instead of 2 50 See NG Week 3 5 01 Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos increases of 20 When asked the implication for missed earnings and their plans for demand conservation one casino official replied We re in the bright lights business I don t believe the economic doom and gloom First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession which was much worse outside of the US Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates this week The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar which will blow exports With all of the monetary slack consumer credit will not tighten and thus buying will continue witness the lack of destruction in big ticket items purchasing Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this is not everything Productivity gains are strong The economy is becoming more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the whole story Finally I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here well there s my 2 cents Jen Fraser Enron Global Markets Fundamentals 713

Information Administration said on Tuesday Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2 3 percent this year the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U S electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal U S electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours kwh the EIA said That is slightly higher than the 895 8 billion kwh forecast by the agency last month For the entire winter heating season of October through March electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4 6 percent from the previous year the EIA said The increase was driven by the residential and commercial sectors which were forecst to be higher by 8 and 4 percent respectively More electricity plants were expected to switch from natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower the government report said This trend is expected to continue through the first quarter 2001 the EIA said Although the favorable price differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue through the forecast period by the second half of 2001 expected increases in gas fired capacity are expected to keep gas demand for power generation growing The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased natural gas prices in California but the state still faces gas supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its

highest AGA number of recorded history for this week last week or next week by 15 bcf seems a little far fetched to me Our analysis is saying gas at 2 50 we would have had 4 5 bcf a day more demand that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing as far as 2 bcf d power gen demand that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5 still and hydro way down every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify we re trying to build the stack now to estimate frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors will continue coming back a little concerned about 2 oil prices bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100 000 last week as gas got to parity let me look into inj capability definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower my initial thoughts bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now really inactive to clarify not raging bull i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10 15 back doesnt make any sense however as more fields start turning around throughout month the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there must close one way or the other notice that spread tightened to 6 8 towards end of trading friday in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here 50 cents lower and no switching no processing and gain back some demand market needs to see some big stg numbers first i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads Jan 4 3 5 look great to me if we get back to 2 8 and don t match last year s early weather bombs away slafontaine globalp com on 03 03 2001 07 03 14 AM To jarnold enron com cc Subject friday this doesnt allow for new generation demand which is unclear cuz it requires power px also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient weather of course but 2bcf d sounds hi esp shudnt happen until loads peak in july shud be marginal in apr jun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys 4 6 demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for R C energy conservation ie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat down its making a difference that will be less factor in shoulder demand months reason why i think y on y s d swing will be closer to 5 bcf apr jun if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think we ll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the 7 4 is vs gas at sub 6 00 ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come back but it is as i consider extraordinary demand destruction those things which never really have occured before like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins ie liquids which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel some ammonia fert prod has

to exit March at roughly 700 800 Bcf compared with just over 1 000 Bcf last year at the end of the traditional withdrawal season 2 Meanwhile domestic natural gas production should rise 3 0 5 0 this year largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency or production added per rig 3 Nonetheless under most scenarios incorporating numerous other variables such as the pace of economic expansion fuel switching and industrial plant closures it appears that storage levels at the beginning of winter will be near or below last year s 2 800 Bcf level 4 Thus it appears likely that the heat will remain on natural gas prices throughout 2001 5 Consequently we believe that many E P shares will post solid gains again this year spurred largely by mounting confidence in the sustainability of strong natural gas prices 2001 Natural Gas Conference Call doc ","message_id":"<335119.1075857638410.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"received_time":"2001-02-24

our bid For instance if we are 6 8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7 I will simultaneously lift their 7 s and move my market to 7 9 The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I m bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off If they don t post numbers on the other systems the systems get no liquidity and die I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron s system I don t

utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting any extra demand through spot market in effect they said we re not withdrawing anymore so we ll buy marketers storage they

Sara Shackleton HOU ECT ECT William S Bradford HOU ECT ECT Subject CSFB Columbia Appalachia Hedging Deal The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they re putting together It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks 1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of In brief the deal is a fixed price one basis TCO 67 of the volumes and CNG 33 with a fixed price Nymex component as well It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations The term of the deal is from December 2000 to December 2012 The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22 000 mmBtu d to 13 000 mmBtu d The average daily nominal volume is 17 000 mmBtu d As I understand it these volumes are about 65 of the producers total volumes I ve attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify First there is a question of the monthly cash settlement CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known As I understand it for the December settlement which would be known in early December cash payment would take place on February 15 2000 Second there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp Apparently there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here that has a 15 million guarantee from Enron Corp CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least 100 million CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp for a deal they ve done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB s dealings with EnronCredit com which may be an issue for London rather than Houston However CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties Per Caroline Abramo and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues including this one Ideally CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions Regards Russ

we talk to takes a macro view Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above 6 is a sale from the perspective of shut in industrial demand he believes that between 6 7 no industrial basic industry type can operate He tracks all the plant closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert s group but it seems on a more comprehensive level Jen it would be good for fundamentals to track this number do some scenario analysis on it under various economic conditions like recession I will try to find out what his total number for turned back gas is just ammonia is a little more than 1 2 Bcf which does not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for the summer While he s a seller above 6 he d also be a buyer of summer at lower levels He firmly believes in increased production in 02 still has 1 1 day short based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally think that 1Q02 sees little I know that the fundamentals group is tracking these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q He really believes theories on products being out of whack heat gas crude propane Jim Pulaski is a bull period he really likes april and may on the 0 storage scenario I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the backwardation out there what is the incentive as well with lower baseloads for the summer deliverability should not be an issue I am torn on this one Catequil new fund Paul Touradji used to be with Tiger they do the same analysis as Dwight just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long nat gas through vol or outright Harvard not really sure of the view yet they have not been active in gas just crude products they like buying cheap vol because they do not have MTM issues they like to look out in the calendar years The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are Moore Capital Global Advisors

asked about nat gas and EOL in the US I suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US In particular Chris Mahoney gasoil trader will be in Houston the 27 t0 30 I told him he should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time Chris is a really good guy His team loves him and will definitely play a large role in turning the crude and products group around Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of good advice I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor and the gambling but there are a lot of good people in crude and

globalp com on 12 22 2000 07 11 26 AM To slafontaine globalp com cc Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Subject Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December 21 2000 Page E01 Kaiser Aluminum Corp had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration s Columbia River dams Then it saw a better deal With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard of peaks Kaiser shut down its two U S smelters last week It is selling the electricity it no longer needs for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long standing contracts It is a measure of this winter s fuel crunch Some big industrial firms in energy intensive sectors such as paper fertilizers metals and even oil field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy described as unprecedented by analysts will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer for example are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy analysts said The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don t know what they re going to use to grow crops with said David Wyss chief economist at Standard Poor s Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter s heating bills on an already weakening economy Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than 1 000 for a typical U S household That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers 20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago they estimated cutting the expected growth in the nation s economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year Overall the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown the Goldman Sachs report concluded Terra Industries Inc in Sioux City Iowa has closed three of its six U S ammonia plants which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production Like Kaiser the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract said Mark Rosenbury chief administrative officer We looked at these current prices and said This is crazy he said Terra hasn t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas but Rosenbury said it would be substantial In coming months Terra s good fortune could be reversed It usually buys gas a month at a time and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break even point That would keep Terra s plants closed Rosenbury said but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit If this persists Rosenbury said it s going to be a real problem He estimates that out of a total annual U S production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia about 4 million tons of production isn t operating now Could we be short of fertilizer next spring It s possible that farmers will not have as much as they want Rosenbury said Royster Clark Inc a Norfolk and New York City based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque Ill indefinitely and 72 production workers will be laid off beginning next month The story is the same natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production We believe it s likely this is a speculative bubble in natural gas prices that will burst and in a few weeks we ll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price but that remains to be seen said Paul M Murphy the company s managing director for financial planning A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers decisions to plant feed corn he said It s sticker shock According to Wyss if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above 7 per million cubic feet double the level a year ago farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002 In the aluminum industry several smaller producers have joined Kaiser the industry s No 2 manufacturer in closing down noted Lloyd O Carroll an analyst with BB T Capital Markets in Richmond Aluminum production in November was 8 3 percent below that of November 1999 and December s production will be lower still he said We ll get more production cut announcements I think he said A slowing in the U S and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies But if the world economy doesn t fall completely apart then aluminum prices are going to rise and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast he said In Kaiser s case it s an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at 22 50 a megawatt per hour says spokesman Scott Lamb That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for 550 a megawatt hour for December But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut down plants to invest in new electric generating capacity or even to refund to Bonneville s other customers said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits Out here a deal is a deal but it has to be a moral deal There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we re not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly owned power Mosey said 2000 The Washington Post Company ","message_id":"<16382576.1075857641512.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"received_time":"2000-12-22

training program when you arrive Not sure about that last statement though The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas gas and power There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program That s a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses Not

two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances From David Forster ENRON enronXgate on 05 08 2001 09 55 AM To John Arnold HOU ECT ECT cc Savita Puthigai ENRON enronXgate Subject John You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out of hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality The simplified description is It tracks two variables Intensity Speed and Bias Buy or Sell emphasis As Intensity increases the Spread increases As Bias increases the Offset increases I ll call later to see what you think of the idea Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision making program will need to work with several criteria inputs definitions These might be Intensity Speed The average time between transaction attempts regardless of whether they are buys or sells Measured as a moving average over the last Intensity Factor transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product Obviously the lower the Intensity calculation the higher the transaction flow Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow Intensity Factor The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation A possible value for this might be 4 Buys The number of Buys which have occurred Sells The number of Sells which have occured Transaction Count Could be either Buys or Sells whichever last occured Buy Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs Sell Offset The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs Offset Reversion Ratio ORR The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be 0 3 If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be 1 Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR The amount by which Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs or amount Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs A possible value for this might be 0 3 If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1 then the reduction shall be equal to 1 Spread Minimum The minimum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be 0 04 Spread Maximum The maximum Spread value allowed A possible value for this might be 0 50 Offset Minimum The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be 0 Offset Maximum The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells A possible value for this might be 0 50 Initial Offset The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread The Spread used when the program is started Spread Offset Minimum The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer A possible value for this might be 0 01 Dead Interval The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval A possible value for this might be 240 seconds Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user defined Formula Spread integer as per current Stack Manager Offset integer as per current Stack Manager Suspension boolean Whether or not the Product should be suspended Normally False Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas Every time a Transaction occurs or a Dead Interval passes the Criteria will be recalculated and the user defined formulas will be reviewed by the program If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place then Intensity Intensity 240 and Buys Buys TRR and Sells Sells TRR and Buy Offset Buy Offset ORR and Sell Offset Sell Offset ORR If the user defined Formulas see following indicate that a change in spread should occur then if the Offset is zero in the case of a trade occurring or if no trade has occured during the passing of a Dead Interval the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread Offset Minimum If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread Offset Minimum then the Buy Offset or Sell Offset or both as appropriate shall be reduced accordingly Similarly if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread Offset Minimum GUI Formulas Example Constants Intensity Factor 4 Dead Interval 240 Offset Reversion Ratio ORR 0 3 Transaction Reversion Ratio TRR 0 3 Spread Minimum 0 04 Spread Maximum 0 50 Offset Minimum 0 Offset Maximum 0 49 Spread Offset Minimum 0 01 INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula

rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured In this example all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI Simulation Obviously if we want to proceed we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness However to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction please see the attached Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price The warning levels will trigger a pager message The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader not relative price movements but actual price There should be both maximum and minimum price checks e g gas is trading at 5 50 The notification levels could be 8 at the top end and 2 at the bottom end Offset checks will only be against a maximum value Dave

defend your answer Only a number is allowed not an algebraic equation Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A the acquirer which is currently considering acquiring Company T the target by means of a tender offer You plan to tender in cash for 100 of Company T s shares but are unsure how high a price to offer The main complication is this the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking Indeed the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome If the project fails the company under current management will be worth nothing 0 share But if the project succeeds the value of the company under current management could be as high as 100 share All share values between 0 and 100 are considered equally likely By all estimates the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management In fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T If the project fails the company is worth 0 share under either management If the exploration project generates a 50 share value under current management the value under Company A is 75 share Similarly a 100 share value under Company T implies a 150 share value under Company A and so on The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T s shares This offer must be made now before the outcome of the drilling project is known From all indications Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A provided it is at a profitable price Moreover Company T wishes to avoid at all cost the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press Thus you Company A will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer In addition Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the per share value of the company under current management Thus if you offer 50 share for instance Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than 50 As the representative of Company A you are deliberating over price offers in the range of 0 share this is tantamount to making no offer at all to 150 share What price offer per share would you tender for Company T s stock per share ","message_id":"<26551813.1075852711022.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","email_attachment":null,"received_time":"2001-05-11

The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions will begin on April 24th As for naked options I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to you in February but I don t believe we got it back Also I m concerned about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review concerning the long stock portion of your portfolio I m thinking we could knock out the paperwork discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge funds vs naked option margin requirements and walk you through the ACCESS manager proposal in about 30 45 minutes if you re available around 5 PM tonight or tomorrow night With regards to the marginable equity for naked options
