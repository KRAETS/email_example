probably won t get this for a few days I can t tell you how glad I am that you ve had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world and not just a little jealous I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea As for myself this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston I figured by now I d be traveled out but I can t get enough The Caymans were incredible we ate at great restaurants not Bed unfortunately but I did see it got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays Actually I was holding onto bonding with one of the stingrays just floating with the current for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat It was a completely surreal experience Plus the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job and more specifically the new co workers which is never a bad thing Speaking of the new job things are going well I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come There is just an overwhelming amount of information not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US I ve been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade So far so good though I m definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role I had a pledge sister s wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago which was fun and another sister s wedding this weekend here in Houston I tell you it s out of control with all of my friend s weddings engagements Two weekends ago I got hit with 3 yes you heard correctly 3 new engagements of close friends I am very rapidly becoming out numbered on this front Still the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself I just have the feeling I ve got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two or more and am not sure that what I d want now is what I ll want then Okay change of subject getting to deep Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun Fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6 30 am I don t know if it s the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks but you really do lose all track of time there I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover I managed to walk away only 40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good What the future holds I m planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month so I m really looking forward to that And I m still trying to figure out when I m going to come visit you guys I was thinking August given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June so let me know your thoughts September is also an option if that works better for you I think I ll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I m over there if we wanted to and so we d have two weekends Anyway it s obviously still in the incubation phase Hope the trip was a rousing success and I ll talk to you soon Sue ","message_folder":"sent_items"},{"message_subject":"cell","received_time":"2001-05-04

ever I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interes ting The title is The Professor and the Madman A Tale of Murder Insani ty and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary I know it may sound a little dry at first glance but I actually found it extremely interesting If you go to Amazon com there are reviews on all of the books I ve includ ed here There are also a couple of other books I m in the process of read ing right now Galileo s Daughter A Historical Memoir of Science Faith and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine A Life The Galileo book is a little slow to start but has tons of interesting historical references as does E leanor of Aquitaine If I remember correctly you always had a bit of a fo ndness for history I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn t put it down although I have talked to others who didn t find it as enjoya ble Personally I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniquen ess of Eastern culture and the author was

from a Canadian newspaper no less is worth sharing America The Good Neighbor Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a Canadian television commentator What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956 it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris I was there I saw it When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help This spring 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering Americans I d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet the Lockheed Tri Star or the Douglas DC10 If so why don t they fly them Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at Even their draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble I don t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake Our neighbors have faced it alone and I m one Canadian who is tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope Canada is not one of those Stand proud America This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States It is nice that one man realizes it I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it We are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do Maybe each of you can send this to at least one person and

question what ever happened to Gary Stadler Ben and I had a good time we went out a couple of nights and discussed the Enron debacle and where we both want to push on from I too am trying to find something that interests me What with the last 2 3 years at ENE I have been heartily thinking that I want to do something VERY blue collar Not sure what yet but I am interested in getting back to my

interview with another natural gas company up there it s a small company around 450 and the job is for a scheduler not a trader but i ve got a good feeling about the place right now they strike me as

Niclas If you do manage to go just have fun it doesn t have to be it it can just be fun I have an offer in KC right now should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago So things are definitely happening I m just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French you think I m kidding but I ve really been checking this stuff out Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday she was about 6 mos along and the baby didn t make it She had a heart beat when she was born but it was very weak They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott My Mom and Chris s Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday they are managing but it s been really tough Chris is fine health wise which we are all very thankful for but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened So say a little prayer for them if you can I miss you too you were actually in my dream last
