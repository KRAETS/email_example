thought this would be a terrible t hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit h our lives Something we have thought about for a long time It is a trag edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance I feel so sad for all those people who lost everything including a job Dick has been r etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo b will eventually end We have no time frame for him Hope everything is going well for you and your family Take care

at Enron I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it s proposed format Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people It was so sad the day they let all those people go I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job Dick s company has basically been shut down He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business His job will eventually end but we have no time frame I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS It sounds like everyone is doing well Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing Take care All our love P S Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat
