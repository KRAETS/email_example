Working with TW I ve valued this one The California Commission ruled that the Hector Road natural gas recent point in California ought to be made a primary receipt point This would have had the effect of TW losing access right to 200 MMcf d of capacity at SoCalGas Needles receipt point Best case scenario Under SFV rates loss to TW is commodity rates wash and the fuel margin TW calculates the fuel margin to be 5 8MM yr Bad case If shippers on TW try to make the case that TW is at fault for losing the primary access rights then TW is at risk for the demand component of the contracts associated with the 200 MMcf d TW calculates the demand charges loss to be 16 5 MM yr Worse case In addition to actual damages listed above shippers face performance penalties and other contractual damages from their customers and they try to pass those costs on to TW I discussions with TW we concluded that the most likely case fell between best and bad somewhere in the 12 15MM yr range TW believes that without the assistance of CA Gov t Affairs in the case the 12 15 MM yr would have been lost Be happy to discuss with you further Best
