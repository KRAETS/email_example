it has been a long time since we have chatted Things are a cha nge n with my life First I just got back from a little so called vacation where Beth and I d rove from West Palm Beach to Houston We did it over 3 days so it wasn t t hat bad Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn Fl You woul d have loved Destin they have the most amazing sand on their beaches It kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar Very white and has a very fine texture and I felt like I was sink right into the sand www holidayinndestin com Next stop was in New Orleans which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good Cajun food It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t he traffic was not that bad Next stop was in Houston about 5 5 hrs from New Orleans By now I m sure you have asked yourself Why did they do th is drive And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there She re nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http astros mlb com NASApp mlb hou ballpark hou ballpark history jsp She too k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company The bad thi ng is I m not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company T he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo w I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration Not the same bu siness but none the less for the same company Second It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin g to Houston as well Believe it or not this was not by design just a mer e coincident However it has presented some tough questions Do I really want to move again and Do I want to co habitate Moving is the easy part I m starting to become an expert and I was thinking about selling my hou se anyway As for co habitating the jury is still out Beth would have n o problem with the idea but Cold feet

movie Wall Street where they arrest Bud Fox for i nsider trading and it is the beginning of the end Well I think Bud might have worked here and the whole company seems to be coming down with him I don t know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another com pany down here as a way of staying afloat We seem to have run out of cash and can t pay the bills Visa and Mastercard are maxed out Its kind of got me soul searching and I m trying to decided what to do next I can sta y where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger but its kind of lik e sticking with the Expo s no one is certain what the future is Or I can try and jump ship catch on with another gas trading company but the prob lem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence Hence t he soul searching and dilemma Anyway I just thought I d drop you a note see how things are going Dolphins seem to be doing ok 6 2 life could b e worse I m going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forwar d to the couple of days off And I m coming to Calgary for Christmas I g et in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day drinks at minimum Anyway I have to get back to work I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the
