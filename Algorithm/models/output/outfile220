Goal Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES Performance Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across EES A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results presented to the Finance Committee A RAC task force has been put in place which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit control systems where they need to be Significant progress has been made against these recommendations DSM projects have been spot tested

policy beyond Houston and London Performance Complete and Ongoing During 2000 Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to A data base system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC AA and operations to really understand where we have risks It also helps in defining where we don t have responsibility such as EOTT Azurix and The

Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting The concept is that a deal flows into a website that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund bill track etc Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim Lets review presentation then discuss with Ben Andy and Janet D and proceed to banks Ben is clearing idea with Delaney We are shooting for a Friday 23 meeting Thanks Rick","received_time":"2001-02-20

floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time Only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate Many will have to be multidimensional There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the RAC group that you are in Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues De silo ization All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect Teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction Offer to help out if needed If formal cross training is necessary force it to happen Encourage weak links in team to perform Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present This may take one quarter to implement If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there You can have an impact This process should begin immediately Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort Rick","received_time":"2001-02-08

floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it expands both in volume and scope Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time Only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate Many will have to be multidimensional There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the RAC group that you are in Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues De silo ization All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect Teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction Offer to help out if needed If formal cross training is necessary force it to happen Encourage weak links in team to perform Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present This may take one quarter to implement If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there You can have an impact This process should begin immediately Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort Rick","received_time":"2001-02-08

a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding We will have to watch this issue carefully Are banks reluctant to

you are now aware the United Way Campaign has now kicked off and RAC is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place First of all Monday morning each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week The building blocks symbolize Enron s commitment to Building Houston s Future with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community To highlight this week s activities On Wednesday August 8 many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 Enron Days of Caring The Enron Corporate Team of which RAC is a large and important part will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity thank you If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to please contact any one of this year s RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators Cindy Hudler Rebecca Phillips Darren Vanek Shelli Smith Becky Caudle Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider On Friday August 10 Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick Fil A and activities to celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around Enron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team Please plan on coming out to join in the celebration and support our colleagues Of course underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002 This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison In addition to providing their typical day to day community services many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need Remember approximately 0 90 out of every 1 00 go directly to benefit our friends neighbors and fellow citizens in the Houston area I sincerely encourage you to support RAC s objective of 100 participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources website at https hrglobal enron com Thanks for
