Reclassification Notice Posted 3 29 00 2 00 pm On February 10 1999 the FERC approved Docket No CP97 549 granting CNG Transmission s CNGT s request for reclassification of various transmission lines to gathering lines As part of that Docket several transmission lines were denied to gathering On March 12 1999 CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification On March 21 2000 the FERC approved Docket No CP97 549 001 granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines The newly reclassified gathering lines include D 2149 H 19921 LN 943 H 124 and H 21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station On March 22 2000 CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1 2000 Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of 0 198 Dt and a fuel retention of 2 28 for all gas moved on the lines listed above If you have questions regarding this notice please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 304 623 8698 or Celesta Miracle at 304 623 8262 April 3 2000 Received 4 3 00 11 10 am Posted 4 3 00 11 10 am Dear Pool Operator CNG Transmission Corporation CNGT plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant H E P out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12 01 a m on Tuesday September 12 2000 This requires that the wet gas system behind the H E P in West Virginia be shut in The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty one 21 days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday October 3 2000 All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT s local operations supervisor in the production area Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT all wet gas production must be shut in by 5 00 p m on Monday September 11 2000 This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time lines on our schedule As per CNGT s tariff failure to shut in by 5 00 p m will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine and in an effort to minimize confusion producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT s local operations supervisor We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in CNGT will not notify producers individually We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year The next regularly scheduled shut down will not be until 2002 If you have any questions about this letter please feel free to contact me at 304 623 8698 Sincerely Nancy M Aucremanne Manager Producer Services And Business Agreements ANNUAL FACILITY

understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the citygate deals that Terry puts it into Sitara for him The offset also entered by Terry is a sale to CES Now the New Power Company effective Sept 1 with commercial usually Chris Germany confirming the sale price Angie schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create track and balance like usual Is that not the case here Is this

Dear West Virginia Producer Over the last several years Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers For this second offering the process we will use is as follows For a period of 30 days beginning 12 00 Noon on May 24 2000 the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will

Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering Production Office The application must indicate the amount of incremental gas for the specific compression agreement Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be

enough however to spread paint on all four walls of a 20X20 foot room 5 You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on When using the ceiling fan as a bat you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way 6 The glass in windows even double pane doesn t stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan 7 When you hear the toliet flush and the

to the back of the bar and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt takes her knickers down and the old man drops his trousers She turns around and as she hangs on to the fence the old

capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system Please submit your

that the installation of compression requires differing time frames We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis Please include in your written

April 00 Requirements for 4 10 00 and after The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for and the following day s as listed There are three worksheets labelled as follows Total Reqs Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled NOM The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice CES schedulers note the attached file is archived on P Energy Ops Enron April 00 Daily xls so you don t have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network Daily Change shows the change increase decrease in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date For the current gas day the change is an intra day change and is calculated using the previous day s volume request for the current day e g If the current gas day is 3 28 then the change is computed with respect to the 3 27 request for 3 28 Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated For tomorrow s gas day and any subsequent ones shown the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First of the month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first of the month to the FOM supply for the future days shown e g If today is 3 28 then the change for 3 29 3 30 etc is computed with respect to the first of the month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell backs since the first of the month thru 3 27 This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back The column labelled ENA Daily Swing vs FOM volume shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre specified prices Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre specified pricing must be negotiated TCO Storage Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its paper storage injection for the month Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the Daily Change worksheet Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues Doug Kinney

make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged Stop trying so hard You are very talented imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it on your own In preference you would like to team up with someone someone with similar attributes as your own to explore to seek out and go perhaps where no other man has trod before It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn So it would appear that you are holding back re consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being You are holding back You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all The existing situation is not of your liking you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of total surrender This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome You feel that only by control controlling your innermost thoughts are you able to maintain your air of superiority You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done In essence you need to be needed and at the same time you need to need You need to be respected as an exceptional individual This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve You set yourself very high standards and come what may you abide by them Don t date or hook yourself up

imbalances on Dominion and I m not having much luck Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone When I called back a day later to get the EES balances I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers Dominion s in house counsel I have not done that I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11 30 01 and 12 31 01 Based on the pool balances below I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12 3 01 assuming the following 1 Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre petition bucket 2 ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre petition 3 The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer s pool Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12 31 01 or later ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering transporting charges associated with those balances The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process Also the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance On 12 3 01 ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity I assume that since those dollars go into a pre petition

Loan","message_body":"Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat This is what we have found out over the last 2 days ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat s scheduling Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler believes that under normal conditions we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it I need to know 1 What volume to sell I assume we are talking about 188 949 dth on deal 1222 which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96 000 dth on deal 1424 2 What period do I sell the gas for All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline Or base load in April I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that s ok 3 How many bids do I need to get I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat 4 This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 see items in red down below Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas I don t want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it All of my previous notes are shown below in blue Summary Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance 92 949 dth per my conversation with Sonat to offset 879 030 42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001 According to Sonat the payment was due November 26 2001 but ENA did not pay Sonat s motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th 2 19 02 History Per Dave Dyer 205 326 2007 at Sonat ENA has 2 Park Loan PAL contracts with Sonat All PAL s with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001 Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract Deal 1424 ENA borrowed a total of 96 000 dth from Nov 3rd 5th and has not paid this back ENA still owes Sonat 96 000 dth The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002 SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA 96 00 FOR THIS DEAL because Sonat needed to get gas off the system Deal 1222 ENA parked 309 192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002 Sonat let ENA withdraw 42 951 on 11 29 01 leaving a balance of 266 241 dth In Jan 2002 ENA withdrew 8 588 dth per day for the 1st 9th That left a balance of 188 949 dth On Jan 8th 2002 Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1 the Loaned gas on deal 1424 96 000 dth and 2 to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 According to Sonat the remaining balance on this deal is 92 949 dth 309 192 parked in Aug 42 951 w d in Nov 77 292 w d in Jan 92 000 balance on 1424 According to Sonat s letter Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets According to Dave ENA is being billed 00305 x daily balance in this account ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August Other items ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001 ENA purchased 286 998 at an average price of 3 063 879 030 42 According to Sonat ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy ENA also sold Sonat gas 16 000 dth day at 2 885 sitara 1172076 in January 2002 and 10 000 dth day at 2 955 in May 2002 sitara 1172087 ENA used 77 292 dth of the parked gas on deal 1222 to supply the 16 000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park ENA defaulted on 418 708 dth of the Sonat deal in January Sonat s in house legal counsel is Patti Frances 205 325 7696 I left a message for Patti to call me 2 20 02 Patti Frances returned my call Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77 292 dth 8 588 dth per day for Jan 1st 9th that ENA did supply Patti said she didn t think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed She will check on it and call me back 2 25 02 Per Kay Mann Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract 1 10 PM Left a follow up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2 20 02 3 11 02 Per Ruth Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal Christina Sanchez ENA Scheduler will find out 1 if we still have access to Sonat s EBB and 2 if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL s 3 13 02 Per Christina ENA s ID s and passwords have been cancelled Christina called Barbara Gilbert 205 325 7310 ENA s account rep at Sonat Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat s legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL s meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream 3 30 PM Tammi Depaolis 832 397 1728 at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out 3 40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat s legal department

Coopers voicemail transcript","message_body":"Hi everybody It s Steve Cooper It s Friday afternoon March 1 I hope everybody has had a great week I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week so that you all will be fully in the loop The week started in a rough and tumble fashion I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex colleagues Their disappointment upset and anger is very understandable I along with the entire management team have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency 5 million fund We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees I wanted you to be aware of that I really do appreciate and understand everybody s upset Last Friday February 22 we presented to the Creditors Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program As can be expected there was some push back from the committee there were issues about some of the data there were requests for additional data and further clarification The Creditors Committee formed a subcommittee We provided to them more data Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday February 27 and we met with them again on Thursday February 28 We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors Committee on this program I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff s and my highest priority It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future their future compensation and any financial safety net so we are going to have to move on this at light speed I told the creditors subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court I ll keep you posted on progress I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs Hopefully by the time we have the employee meeting we can walk through the composition of the program in detail The powers that be management in conjunction with the human resources group are working on merit increases and promotions Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week Then the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases And it works its way through the review approval and communication process So hopefully we ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron 2 1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract It is a shame we won t be in a position to support the naming of the field but it is probably in the best interest of the estate I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex employees fund I d like your input on that I thought it was a great idea and very generous We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month Hopefully I ll be able to meet many of you there I ve tried to get around to say hello here and there And again I would encourage you if you have any questions concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you but I m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody s inquiries Other than that I don t have a lot to report We ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program Hopefully by next Friday I ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area I want to thank everybody for their efforts all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward One other thing We did have a bank

interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I haven t heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buy sells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buy sell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enron s then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the

John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy sell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now he s priorities are just a bit different I guess why I m a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA s Wade Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal If it s pool I don t know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator Joanie Do you have any insight into this

method","message_body":"Look a funny A new method HOW TO BATHE THE CAT 1 Thoroughly clean the toilet 2 Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water and have both lids lifted 3 Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom 4 In one smooth movement put the cat in the toilet and close both lids you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape CAUTION Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find 5 The cat will self agitate and make ample suds Never mind the noises that come from your toilet the cat is actually enjoying this 6 Flush the toilet three or four times This provides a power wash and rinse which I have found to be quite effective 7 Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door 8 Stand behind the toilet as far as you can and quickly lift both lids The now clean cat will rocket out of the toilet and run outside where he will dry himself Sincerely The Dog

the Schultz facility until 1 it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or 2 CNG develops a compression pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its

Life","message_body":"A much better note in bottle thrown out to sea I didn t actually write all this mushy stuff Someone sent it to me It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person we will know how to begrateful for that gift Love is when you take away the feeling the passion and the romance in a relationship and find out you still care for that person A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you ve ever had It s true the we don t know what we ve got until we lose it but it s also true that we don t know what we ve been missing until it arrives Giving someone all your love is never assurance that they ll love you back Don t expect love in return just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn t be content it grew in yours There are things you d love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you would like to hear them from but don t be so deaf as not to hear it from the one who says it from his heart Never say good bye if you still want to try never give up if you still feel you can go on never say you don t love a person anymore if you can t let go Love comes to those who still hope although they ve been disappointed There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real Hope you dream of that special someone Dream what you want to dream go where you want to go be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do Always put yourself in others shoes If you feel that it hurts you it probably hurts the person too A careless word may kindle strife a cruel word may wreck a life a timely word may level stress a loving word may heal and bless The happiest of people don t necessarily have the best of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way Happiness lies for those who cry those who hurt those who have searched and those who have tried for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives Love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a tear The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can t go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches When you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling Live your life so that when you die you re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying

would never have scored thirty five points There s no way we lost this one A M demands a recount Oklahoma officials are calling this outrageous They agreed to the size shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick off replies OU coach Bob Stoops If they had a problem with them they should have said so before we started You don t get to keep playing until you re happy with the outcome Someone

are confident that when the points are re totaled we will be the winner of the game says Slocum OU also points out that in many games prior to this one the same end zones were used They didn t have a

won 35 to 31 The end zones were confusing says Slocum I m sure that some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma s end zone were meant to go into ours We were scoring in those end zones also Oklahoma would never have scored thirty five points There s no way we lost this one A M demands a recount Oklahoma officials are calling this outrageous They agreed to the size shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick off replies OU coach Bob Stoops If they had a problem with them they should have said so before we started You don t get to keep playing until you re happy with the outcome Someone had to lose We ve scored over thirty five points many times A M has sent lawyers farmers and those guys in the funny boots as well as Reville down to Kyle Field where the scoreboard will be tested We are confident that when the points are re totaled we will be the winner of the game says Slocum OU also points out that in many games prior to this one the same end zones were used They didn t have a problem with the end zones until they lost says Stoops Outside of Kyle Field A M student protesters have gathered bearing signs such as A M wants a fair game WHOOOOOOP Students thoughts echoed their signs All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a winner says student Karen Hays an Aggie from Marfa We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner ABC around 2 00pm central time had mistakenly declared A M the winner despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point At about 2 30 pm with the game still to close to call ABC had to back off its prediction College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call We felt that with a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies we were certain A M would carry this

hand and asked What gender is a computer The teacher wasn t certain and divided the class into two groups males in one females in the other and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because 1 In order to get their attention you have to turn them on 2 They have a lot of data but are still clueless 3 They are supposed to help you solve your problems but half the time they ARE the problem 4 As soon as you commit to one you realize that if you had waited a little longer you could have had a better model The men on the other hand decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because 1 No one but their creator understands their internal logic 2 The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else 3 Even your smallest mistakes are stored

every day Now that being said I have a question Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for I have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco Zn3WH ticket 547342 The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta 65 less transport and fuel In the past months we have nominated this gas on one of our IT contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of 0792 plus 45 fuel That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas In January from the 13th 16th we nominated 2009 day from EI57 and transported it on IT contract 2774 for delivery to Midcoast Marketing Inc ticket 568318 Z3 Ethel Midla meter 6083 This path incurred a

Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers For this second offering the process we will use is as follows For a period of 30 days beginning 12 00 Noon on May 24 2000 the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station The Dominion bubbles affected are 4404 4405 Dominion recognizes that although limited there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non compressed gas entering the system Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering Production Office The application must indicate the amount of incremental gas for the specific compression agreement Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers therefore once granted the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion s approval or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement Your name company name and address state of incorporation phone and fax number as well as an e mail address if available should be included please print or type Forward this information to Joseph A Thompson Manager Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering Production Division 500 Davisson

be contacted as soon as possible after June 23 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved Please realize that this is a window and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23

hand and asked What gender is a computer The teacher wasn t certain and divided the class into two groups males in one females in the other and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because 1 In order to get their attention you have to turn them on 2 They have a lot of data but are still clueless 3 They are supposed to help you solve your problems but half the time they ARE the problem 4 As soon as you commit to one you realize that if you had waited a little longer you could have had a better model The men on the other hand decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because 1 No one but their creator understands their internal logic 2 The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else 3 Even your smallest mistakes are stored

well needed to be covered up anyway It just wasn t worth it to retrieve the donkey He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well At first the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly Then to everyone s amazement he quieted down A few shovel loads later the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw With every shovel of dirt that hit his back the donkey was doing something amazing He would shake it off and take a step up As the farmer s neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal he would shake it off and take a step up Pretty soon everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off Now the Moral of the Story Life is going to shovel dirt on you all kinds of dirt The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up Each of our troubles is a stepping stone We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping never giving up Shake it off and take a step up Remember the five simple rules to be happy 1 Free your heart from hatred 2 Free your mind from worries 3 Live simply 4 Give more 5 Expect less

Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12 31 2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance Questions that need to be answered will ENA have to pay the producers for December
