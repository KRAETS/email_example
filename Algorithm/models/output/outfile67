Overview of Juno The company finished 4Q00 w 56MM in cash Total net loss for 2001 was projected to be 10 25MM as the company focuses on billable services continues to reduce expenses and looks to develop advertising and other ancillary revenue streams The company is confident that it can meet or beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on hand cash resources are more than adequate to get the business profitable The company has not publicly given a time line for profitability to maintain flexibility The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences 4MM

subscription fees and 35 from advertising 2001 revenues are expected to come in between 100MM 120MM with the revenue mix moving toward 80 subscription and 20 advertising due to increased focus on
