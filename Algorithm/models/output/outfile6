The Siting Board s decision marks the beginning of the State s formal review process and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580 megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility The ruling kicks off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy facility with the Siting Board as required under Article X of the State of New York Public Service Law on June 25 2001 This application which the State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance addresses all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project including its design location fuel use and air and water quality The New York Siting Board s ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power said Peter Giller International Power s Chief Executive Officer We are planning to begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004 he added For additional information please contact Media contact Europe Aarti Singhal 44 0 20 7320 8681 Media Investor contact United States Paul

By Marianne White QUEBEC CITY Aug 20 Reuters In order to reaffirm the precarious status of French in North America Quebecers should have their own citizenship a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship the report added The goal is to make everyone including new immigrants English speaking residents and native peoples feel that they are part of Quebec a French speaking island in an English dominated North America We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society said the chairman of the task force Gerald Larose a trade unionist who favors Quebec s separation from Canada As far as language is concerned living in Quebec is not like living in Canada Larose added The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message said Diane Lemieux minister responsible for the French language adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy The language task force which crisscrossed the predominantly French speaking province which is three times the size of France over the past 12 months unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French and says that if they fail they should not be hired It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French About 82 percent of Quebec s six million people describe French is their mother tongue French has been Quebec s official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs although other languages may also appear Quebec has 1 4 million people whose first language is not French Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec which has held two referendums on separating from Canada In the last one in 1995 Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor thin margin English and

By Kanina Holmes WINNIPEG Manitoba Aug 16 Reuters Canadians sometimes divided by regional differences economic disparities or linguistic snits find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon a national drought From Atlantic to Pacific from the Arctic to the U S border most of the world s second largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades In many ways this drought is the same tune that s being played right across the country It s a different look different season and different impact but nevertheless everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country said David Phillips a senior climatologist with Environment Canada Whether it s fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario many will remember the summer of 2001 It ll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think Too much excess and not enough normal said Phillips In parts of British Columbia water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter s record low snowfall in the mountains We ve had normal summer in terms of rain But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble said Jim Mattison Water Management Director for B C s Bureau of Sustainable Resources But the devastation is most apparent in Canada s breadbasket the Prairies Many farmers especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan have already written off their crops I ve been here since 63 I have never in my life ever seen anything like this Norman Stienwand a farmer in Castor Alberta told Reuters IT S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION There s no water The grasshoppers are so bad It s beyond your imagination said Stienwand who farms 1 080 hectares 2 700 acres of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle It has been so sweltering in his region located about 160 km 100 miles west of the Saskatchewan border that some of Stienwand s farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock It s just going to destroy a lot of farmers They re just not going to come out of it he said In June the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds and as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality Last week the Canadian Wheat Board the marketer of western Canada s wheat durum and barley crops forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports In Ontario Canada s most populous province prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see You wouldn t be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they ve got since the twenty second of June said Phillips The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario s soybean crop I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don t see it It s just really really really dry said Debbie Yuck a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks When they come on the radio every morning and say it s a beautiful sunny day great to be at the cottage I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours said Yuck Canada s largest city Toronto has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C 99 F Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling said Phillips a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer The hot dry spell could be a blow to the national economy By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops aiding farmers battling forest fires and generating more electricity it could run into the billions Quebec s multibillion dollar agricultural sector which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry s revenues and produces 38 percent of the country s milk has also been hard hit since early July In southern Quebec where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun ravaged crops The farmers are on the edge of burn out they can barely stand up said David St Cyr a spokesman for Quebec s powerful Agricultural Union The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that for weeks have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins I think there are a majority of Canadians probably who can hardly wait for the winter And I never thought I d ever hear that said Phillips With additional reporting by Robert Melnbardis in

By Andrei Khalip RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil Aug 20 Reuters The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard hit by Brazil s economic woes Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency which has lost about one fourth of its dollar value so far this year and an overall economic slowdown power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months Although the currency s depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half power rationing has already shown its face said Oswaldo Telles power sector analyst with BBV Securities And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity Two years of drought and full use of power stations capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America s largest country Rationing due to last at least until November means lower sales and revenues for power firms while their costs and dollar denominated debt get inflated by the real s losses It s only the beginning of rationing but it gives us an idea of how power utilities distributors in particular will be affected said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander I think we can say that they are suffering the most Out of electricity sector stocks most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel CPLE3 SA of southern Parana state where there is no energy shortage and no rationing GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo s Cesp CESP4 SA utility whose losses rose sharply and Eletropaulo ELPL4 SA controlled by US based AES Corp AES N which posted a net loss after a year ago profit Rio de Janeiro s power distributor Light LIGH3 SA last week posted its biggest half year loss ever of 431 million reais 172 million and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil even though most distributors had long been privatized and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year This year their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again said Telles But they just have to wait till next year Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run up to presidential elections next year In an ironic twist power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government s order for power switchoffs for quota busters the measure that effectively slashes their revenues In the meantime the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause known as Annex V that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing Some have even booked that gain in the latest results although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay Annex V is the biggest question for power firms If there is no compensation they are screwed said another analyst 1 2 5 reais Rio de Janeiro Newsroom 5521 223 7144 For Related News Double Click on one of these codes nN20239370 LIGH3 SA ELPL4

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank We are now considering paying it off however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there Therefore not sure if we really want to pay it off As far as children go we are still waiting for the right time I imagine we will have one in a year or so right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1 2 due to the terrorist attacks Not such a bad place to be stuck I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there It is different from most great cities in the world For example Paris Rome London NYC are all famous for the great buildings etc however Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see as far as a city settings go The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the
