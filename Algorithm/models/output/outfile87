Management Department PREAMBLE PARAGRAPH TWO There are various references to this SC Agreement which is not a defined term anywhere should the reference to this SC Agreement really mean this Confirmation Letter or this Master Agreement ARTICLE 2 SECTION 2 1 has a reference to SCE1 which appears to be different that the reference to the Delivery Point which is defined as SP 15 SECTION 2 2 has a reference to to Attachment 1and there is no Attachment 1 SECTION 2 4 v was deleted and SECTION 2 4 vi was renumbered as SECTION 2 4 v SECTIOM 2 4 v indicates that the Index Price shall be the Dow Jones Index NP 15 why is this the case when earlier in SECTION 2 1 the Delivery Point is defined as SP 15 The last sentence indicates a name of Hanson which I believe should really be RCWMD SECTION 2 5 again has reference to this SC Agreement which I believe should be this Confirmation Letter or this Master Agreement Also there is a reference to RCWMD s usage shouldn t the terminology in the case of this contract be production and deliveries ARTICLE 3 SECTION 3 1 should have the following added to the beginning of the sentence RCWMD SECTION 3 2 again refers to terminology energy deliveries and usage which I believe should be energy production and deliveries ARTICLE 4 SECTION 4 2 refers to consumed which I believe should be delivered or produced SECTION 4 5 has a reference to Attachment 2 and there is no Attachment 2 There is again a reference to receive and consume which should probably be deliver and consume SECTIOM 4 7 refers to Term Purchase which is not a defined term at least in the Confirmation Letter There is also a reference to Exhibit A and there is no Exhibit A we previously referred to Attachments rather than Exhibits so we need to make sure that we are consistent ARTICLE 5 SECTION 5 1 contains language regarding Scheduling Coordination services is this fee normal and did you intend for it to be included in this contract ARTICLE 6 SECTION 6 1 contains reference to this SC Agreement which I believe should be this Confirmation Letter or this Master Agreement SECTION 6 2 contains reference to this Agreement which I believe should be this

Membership Subcommittee at its January 24 2000 meeting On e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po licy for NEPOOL Members EESI Enron Energy Marketing Corp and Enron Powe r Marketing Inc are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond s rather than corporate guaranty due to Enron s disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL EESI via Fireman s Fund Insurance Company issued a Performance Bond in th e amount of 8 000 000 in June 2000 the Performance Bond was reissued in J une 2001 in the amount of 8 000 000 EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10 2001 addressed to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements and received by Becky probably October 12 2001 indicating that EESI s cu rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th e amount to 11 703 018 75 to cover EESI s current activity level Becky d elivered the October 10th letter to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department Karen Cordova and informed Karen that EESI need ed to increase the Performance Bond to 20 000 000 Karen requested Credit Department Nichole Gunter initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t o the 20 000 000 level to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati on with Credit Department was October 12 2001 In telephone conversations with ISO NE Enron s Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO NE t hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r esolved within ten 10 days of the date of the October 10 2001 letter Oc tober 19 2001 however the letter did not indicate such 20 I was notified by Credit Department on October 16 2001 that the bond compa ny Enron utilizes for performance bond s would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin g invoices for other performance bonds bond renewals approximately 1 50 000 The other performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI since June 2001 to various individuals i e Greg Sharp Mark Mueller J eff Golden Scott Mills and had still remained unpaid Payments for the other performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to 20 000 000 which w as issued by the bond company on October 23 2001 executed by EESI on Octo ber 23 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO NE on October 23 2001 EESI was unable to comply with the October 19 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above Credit Department personnel informed ISO NE pe rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19 2001 deadline but was wor king diligently to resolve the matter Credit Department personnel sent via FAX a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor mance Bond to ISO NE personnel on October 19 2001 20 I notified Dan Allegretti Enron Government Affairs Chariman NEPOOL Par ticipants Committee of the entire situation prior to October 19 2001 Da n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems but to get t he matter resolved as quickly as possible Dan advised me that the implicat ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published the following month EESI would no longer be listed as being in default On O ctober 19 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements f rom Edward McKenna Vice President Chief Financial Officer informing EESI that Enron Energy Services Inc has not maintained the required level of financial assurance for 10 days or more and has had a total combination o f 3 financial assurance and or payment defaults in the last 12 months whic h qualifies them as having 2 two Level 1 defaults The ISO has been in c ontact with Enron Energy Services Inc through multiple telephone communic ations and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured Th erefore per the established procedure we are forwarding this information to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them According to Da n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him as Chariman of the Members Subcommittee and he would discuss the issue with them The previ ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19 2001 letter occurred i December 2000 when payment was received 1 2 days late and was automatically resolved when payment was received and ii September 2001 when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a ctivity To the best of my knowledge EESI was unaware of either the Decem ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default and no information was received by EESI from ISO NE relative to either inc idence According to i Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce edings and ii conversations with Dan Allegretti the issue should be reso lved with the receipt on October 24 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO NE I have also advised the ISO NE in the future to send communications to EESI s Credit Department and not EESI s Settlements Also Dan Allegretti is investigating the facts leading the the October 19 2001 letter with re presentatives from ISO NE I left message for Molly Harris as you requested I was able to speak to De nise Furey and Nichole Gunter who both indicated that they would speak wit h Molly as they all work together 20

September 1 2010 Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6 2001 RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001 0ctober 2001 and November 2001 I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001 EESI myself and EPMI Chris Foster were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the green tickets from EPMI associated with the power production There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the fixed price volume committments and penalties I do not know who if anyone is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI s and or EPMI s desires for the future of this agreement RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10 2001 December 13 2001 and January 8 2002 requesting response from EESI The December 10 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2 2001 I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001 It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD s offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non performance panalties for the termination payment Let me know if you

penalty could be in the range of 150 000 to 640 000 depending on the resoultion of the effective online date for said project The non performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark to market for the agreement I do not have a good handle of the early termination payment except to say that there are approxmiately 390 500 MWh s The average contract fixed price is 33 10 MWh I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be 25 00 MWh which would result in early termination payment of approximately 3 200 000 390 500 33 10 390 500 25 00 Richard "},{"email_attachment":null,"sent_time":"2001-10-29
