past several months Currently Anne is in NY an ISDA conference and will return to the office on Thursday November 29th However yesterday Laurie Orchard CRRC called inquiring as to the status of our review to their latest round of comments some which were Credit in nature Laurie asked that I touch base with you to get your thoughts so that when Anne returns on Thursday we will be closer to a final document form Therefore attached for your review is a redlined version of the latest master agreement draft In reviewing such document please keep in mind that CRRC really wants the following to prevail 1 Part 1 h of the Schedule CRRC would like such language to be included as they have concerns with bankruptcy events 2 Part 5 j of the Schedule CRRC provided transfer language which Anne knew they were to furnish 3 Paragraph 13 b ii CRRC prefers to include only cash because B C do not apply 4 Paragraph 13 b iv B CRRC is more conservative with regard to their matrix threshold and wish that the changes be accepted as noted 5 Paragraph 13 g i CRRC wishes to include or in Bermuda because that is where they maintain their LCs Please be advised there was one other change CRRC requested which related to Paragraph 13 b iv B the determination of the exposure in weather related deals As you know Anne has furnished such language to Mark Tawney for his comments I do not believe that Mark has responded However CRRC is willing to address this later under an amendment to the master Therefore as you can see they are rather eager to sign a master with ENA and they are willing to address some of their issues at a later date Let me know your thoughts Regards Susan S Bailey Senior Legal Specialist Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department 1400 Smith Street Suite 3803A Houston Texas 77002
