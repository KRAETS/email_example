for the sake of working long hours I am pushing for a 4 day work week Why Calgary Why not I love Calgary Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole I think it is a promotion Besides Houston in the arm pit of the world This city has few redeeming features What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty Actually it isn t that bad Houston has good restaurants decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can Kerrie got engaged Good for her I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention I am not engaged I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela No big loss Too old for me anyway 31 Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY I am going to have to visit some time I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination Or is NY home for a while No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen s wedding this weekend Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring Do a little Amsterdam Paris London whirlwind tour My family is doing great My dad
