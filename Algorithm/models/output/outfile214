It has been a very successful year for the Enron Razorfish VMS project Team We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market user managed tariff based calculation engine and customer expense revenue allocation application The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets The current application has gone through the following evolution Project Definition Design documentation Database Design Development User Interface Design Development Communication layer COM Design Development Hardware requisition Implementation Development Test Production Arthur Anderson Audit Passed Audit review Application meets all minimum requirements The Major Functionality Action Items which have been delivered to date Security Management Only IT Resources to have access Event Task Management Reporting Component Equations Management Reporting Estimation Generation Management Reporting Counter Party Profile Management Reporting Settlement Entity Profile Management Reporting Deal Upload Management Reporting Integrated Dispute Management Reporting Customer Generation Charge Profile Reporting Historical Data Conversion mechanism 95 of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements The Major Functionality which is under it s final steps of Development and User Test Reconciliation Exception Identification Allocation Reporting Settlement Entity Settlement Statement Invoice Parsing Reporting Remaining 5 of Calculation Engine Functionality Over the past 12 months a total of 3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS We are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that everyone is still on board with this being OUR Enron Volume Management strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets As of March 1 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the Enron Networks IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year These resources have been key in helping us get to where we are today In addition we had originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 03 2001 12 2001 to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office Without a contract in place and currently working on good faith The project has come to a serious point of action Razorfish is asking for a total of 728 000 for services rendered between 3 1 2001 and 6 30 2001 They will keep the resources dedicated to the project and will deliver the following Finalise base product development assist in unit user testing and Implement base VMS Product in Production Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to Enron Networks IT resources Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist Enron throughout the remainder of the year However I don t feel that everyone is ready to make that decision We do however need to make a final decision on this first implementation As I have stated prior in this document We have accomplished a lot over the past year Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion of the VMS team I don t see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management VM Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical fashion In some cases I don t see it being possible at all It is time to make a decision Do we all agree that we need to move forward and retain Razorfish services for the additional 728 000 and incur each of OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to determine who picks up the 3 MM already spent Please provide me with your response by 5 00 PM PT to allow me to get back to Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday Thanks
