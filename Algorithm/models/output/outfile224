11th 2 days after our 12th wedding anniversary I hadn t spoken to him at all that day and he wasn t able to call after the attack I only hope that he wasn t frightened and that he didn t suffer Some of the other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they said that they were going to be evacuated None of the 36 people who worked for Chris got out and in total there were nearly 700 employees of Cantor Espeed and TradeSpark that didn t survive We are all in a state of shock and disbelief Chris would have turned 36 on 9 22 He was the most wonderful hardworking dedicated easy going kind loving and respectful person I have ever known He never had a bad word to say about anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body The children and I 5 feel like our lives ended that same day I can t imagine moving on or ever being happy again There is no reason for this dispicable act this world will never be the same There were many articles about Chris in various papers here in NJ and NY I was also on CNN when we were searching for him You can find these at the Starledger com NYtimes com the Stamford Advocate Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa com website I have set up a trust fund for the children if you are interested The address is The Christopher Wodenshek Children s Trust c o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court Street Hackensack NJ I am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris but that sounds familiar to me If so I wanted to let him know the Ted Mahoney or Maloney was also at Cantor and is also amoung the missing Thanks again for your kind card and

preservation versus cashflow preservation We have been valued in P L under the US but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C i e the preponderence of cashflows were in C from the legacy gas deals PetroCanada Suncour etc and the PPA position Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US traders would hedge C positions immediately as the trade occured The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book From a P L systems point of view this would preserve the trader s P L in US However from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades physical trades and inter company trades There was also some currency risk albeit small between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems To a certain extent I am indifferent if it is US or C The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29 This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston As a result we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28
