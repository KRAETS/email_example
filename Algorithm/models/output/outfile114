him that the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to consider membership and certification if it applied and to send in a request if he thought that standards should be developed We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requests for standards development and have only declined to process a handful of requests because they were out of scope If he considered that the request for standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization it would have a good chance of moving forward Our plate right now is pretty full as it always has been but that has never stopped a company from requesting that additional standards be development We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and looked forward to working with him in the future I am not sure that he will follow up with us on membership certification or providing a request which would go through our normal process I will keep you updated as or if this progresses Best Regards Rae The GISB mission statement as adopted by the Board of Directors is The Gas Industry Standards Board mission is to develop and

something for you to ponder and then respond please David Hill put us in touch with Marco Crespi who is at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Trust FSB in New Jersey There is no local office of MSDW Trust and by local I mean in the State of Texas not just Houston Marco assures us that MSDW Trust has authority to conduct trust business in all 50 states and is sending us evidence of same I am not worried about their authority to do trust business here but I am worried a bit about what I explain below Marco has informed us that since MSDW Trust has no local presence they will not accept appointments to the more personal or high contact positions such as agent attorney in fact under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and executor under a Last Will and Testament Basically all they take at this point are trustee appointments This obviously puts a kink in your plans as outlined at our meeting in your office on April 3 with David Hill and in our follow up e mails We have rough drafts of your documents in process and expected to send you some first drafts by mid week next week but all those drafts name MSDW Trust to the various positions you had in mind some of which we now know are not feasible If you want to name MSDW Trust as co trustee on all the trusts whether created now or under your Will that will work fine However you will not very well be able to bridge the gap during any period of incapacity under a Power of Attorney or during any period of estate administration under a Will with another corporate fiduciary as co agent or co executor who then is expected to hand off to MSDW Trust as trustee In other words if you really want MSDW Trust in there for the long haul as co trustee on all the trusts both now and after your death your best bet is probably to have only an individual serve as agent or executor say your wife for example as those jobs are temporary to bridge the gap until the trusts are fully funded after your estate administration is completed If you have any reticence about naming only an individual as agent or executor again say your wife you might consider having two individuals named together as co agent and co executor to ameliorate your concerns say Caron with your wife Of course if you want to shop around town a bit for a corporate fiduciary who could and would serve as co agent and co executor we can provide a list of several banks and trust companies and introduce you to most in the city Baker Botts has no horse in this race other than you and Debbie of course and we will not favor MSDW Trust or any other trust company one over another You favor MSDW though and I d like to help you work out a plan that uses them Please let me know your thoughts as I know you are eager to put at least some of this to bed soon and Adam Schucher here at Baker Botts has prepared first drafts that require only my review and revisions prior to sending them to you It just looks now like there may be more revisions than we originally

conditioned on making a 12 1 01 compliance filing that addresses seams issues with California and Canada and a timetable for creating a West wide RTO Together these orders should help prevent California s efforts to balkanize their power system 4 FERC s order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the independent for profit transmission company TransConnect proposed by 6 of the 9 RTO utilities including PGE Relying heavily on TransConnect s independence the Commission approved TransConnect s proposal to file for innovative and incentive rates 5 Wholesale sales

for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement I would like to make a suggestion for the retirement plan for others When the 27 page retirement letter is sent that a time table of when items will be in place or transferred be included 3 9 months or when Medical Forms can t be put in now until after you leave I went back to the office to HR and they put the information in the system Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the card Dr offices like to see the card I was tolled I wasn t even in the system So I called back to Omaha HR and they worked to get it in place When I went to get a RX I was not in that system either and had to come home and call HR and start over with that system The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date is the Cash Balance Plan The Savings Plan and ESOP are not transferred to my Financial Plan They tell me they will be this is why I feel a timeline would be helpful Until I received my Medical Card I put off going to the Dr Also I haven t wanted to take a trip because I am unsure of when funds will be transferred Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY with 2 shares of ENRON stock So I called NY to see what Fund that was from they didn t know they were just to set up a account I called the Enron retirement line and they didn t know what Fund that was from either Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just don t have answers ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working this doesn t seem like that in retirement I share this because

Review I agree that makes a lot of sense that is certainly where we are spending our time and good management of that so far is what is contributing to earnings higher than expected that and the crazy California markets We re always glad to have you visit and could provide a detailed discussion if that s what you would prefer We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales presentations and have a number of overheads and some written information that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with The rate case is in a very dynamic state but we believe moving in right direction The power position is in constant review based on projected loads demand side management opportunities and blocks of energy available at reasonable prices in the future for our customers We are still operating under an obligation to serve as we don t see that changing anytime in the near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are those who haven t provided for customers Commissions seem to be giving rate increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted but not just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg We have a sharing mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and shareholders During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working through with Sierra on this and now with the new possible buyers Most like it when they finally understand It is not regulation 101 it is very complex and leading edge but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for shareholdes and customers Doesn t fit Enron s view of dereg but Oregon will not get to Enron s view anytime soon especially with California situation and it s not just Oregon regulators it s Oregon customers including the industrials that are reliability sensitive like high techs and health care Sorry for the long note how about if I start by sending you some information from presentations and then we can look at schedules for when a meeting might work You might even want to come to one of the banker presentations Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday and could share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects Mitch thought we might have another in a week or so Horton Stanley 05 08 01 09 37AM After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review there are two areas that I think I need to understand better The first is PGE s energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices The second is the rate case I would

room in San Francisco 3 FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6 1 01 a RTO proposal with FERC At the same time FERC s approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities IOUs plus BPA to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12 1 01 compliance filing that addresses seams issues with California and Canada and a timetable for creating a West wide RTO Together these orders should help prevent California s efforts to balkanize their power system 4 FERC s order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the independent for profit transmission company TransConnect proposed by 6 of the 9 RTO utilities including PGE Relying heavily on TransConnect s independence the Commission approved TransConnect s proposal to file for innovative and incentive rates 5 Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market 6 Thermal plants are in sequential annual maintenance outages 7 Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW 8 Contract negotiations

and should Wessex decide to enter into the residential power and gas market ED could provide site registration and gas power price risk management services to sit behind the Wessex brand Given that Wessex is Enron s biggest retail platform in Europe have you given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct generally Given current market conditions I expect Enron will have little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn t necessarily a bad thing There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail water and energy businesses together though I think it is worth looking at ED has 150 000 I C customers across the UK making it a good fit for Wessex Also if the Water market opens up to competition in the future there would be

responding to their offer I suspect that a decision should be made early next week I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron s investments in water assets as non core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB That is where we are right now Again please send
