just hours and I believe the season started just a few days later In any case we have already done some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium This may help whoever is managing the contant with the Astros probably David T I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas Nevertheless I strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this opportunity we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to Houston 2 In addition in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions I believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr Mosbacher I would not be surprised if he do it again Probably your team can also target these efforts and keep the action at all fronts Please keep me informed I would like to be involved as much as

RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February 20 2001 We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow up warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract 1 Paragraph 2 PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be 2 Paragraph 5 EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc 3 Paragraph 6 TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY 6 The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent 15 of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly 4 Paragraph 6 TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible 5 Paragraph 6 TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B 3 It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven 7 days after you receive the Commitment and or the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same 6 Paragraph 6 TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY 6 We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted 7 Paragraph 7 PROPERTY CONDITION B 1 We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B 2 which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph 7B 1 states that you will pay a fee usually very small like 100 00 for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly 8 Paragraph 8 BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees 9 Paragraph 11 SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1 2001 whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty 30 days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin 10 Paragraph 13 ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five 5 years 11 Paragraph 18 ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of 50 000 00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSS csb

exhibit an interest in art 01 Entry 20 requirements for this segment could be centered around an Enron based theme 20 such as innovation energy or communication 01 Rewards for winning entrie s 20 could be provided to individual artists as well as teachers professors or 20 the recipient 01 s institution 01 Emphasis would be placed on the communi ty 20 relations aspect of the program and would

international recognition but whose works would be an asset to th e 20 world class operations center being constructed Enron 01 s public relation s 20 departments in the U S and abroad could serve as points of contact for 20 identifying this talent on a world wide basis and for generating publicity 20 for the program 01 This competition would focus on lesser known artists a nd 20 provide Enron with an opportunity to discover new ideas and fresh 20 perspectives while emphasizing the artist s true creative spirit 01 With this 20 new approach your committee will have the opportunity to obtain

to you I ve been traveling again 20 I also just found this in my in box as returned as un delivered I put only 20 two v s instead of three I hope your other discussions went well that 20 day 20 Below are a few comments that i believe you addressed and wanted some 20 additional feedback from our coal activities and changes in the coal 20 industry I wanted to get this out to you quickly so please forgive this 20 lack of formality or writing creativity Enron activity EOL Enron s online activity has been very successful especially as compared wit h 20 our early estimations of acceptance by the industry I believe that there is 20 only one other active coal trading system Dynegy direct that simply isn t 20 posting prices as a bulletin board and waiting for a response with telephon e 20 follow up I also believe that we have done a very significant amount of o r 20 maybe all the coal transactions on Dynegy direct to date We do a lot of o ur 20 business online and the numbers YTD are that approx 45 of our trades are 20 executed online That number has been higher as much as 90 for certain 20 months or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product 20 Also as Bid Ask spreads tighten which we would expect that bodes well fo r 20 EOL and our and the markets ability to transact even more quickly 20 Transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second 20 Between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system 20 we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online business 20 will significantly increase Changes in the industry We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry We see 20 several things on the horizon We expect the acceptance of the online 20 transactions to further increase especially with the volatile price 20 movements what we have seen in the last 6 months We are currently 20 developing several new products for EOL that I believe will become very 20 popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors I don t 20 want to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thi nk 20 they will raise some eyebrows The development of the Global Coal exchan ge 20 will also help I frankly don 01 t believe it will be very successful beca use 20 of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the 20 transaction One thing has been very firmly demonstrated Every time a new 20 big system has been introduced EOL volumes go up It simply accelerates th e 20 acceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and 20 liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day Another big change in th e 20 industry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market The significant pric e 20 changes that have occurred have forced many traditional players to the OT C 20 market This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms and 20 conditions and getting them comfortable with the market This is very good 20 for Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on the 20 OTC market We don t release specific percentages of what we are doing on 20 the OTC Also having more natural and traditional players signing these 20 types of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard 20 contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market Enron coal volumes A couple of numbers that we are willing to release Year to date we have 20 made markets and transacted approx 30 million tons in the forward market 20 On the physical side of our transactions about 25 go physical vs 20 financial Last year Enron was the largest US market maker not producer 20 with 142 million tons transacted Internationally we moved approx 47 20 million tons and overall the total was slightly less than 190 million tons 20 We have high expectations for 2001 I believe that we should be up approx 20 65 and we are on track with that I think the industry would be surprise d 20 that we did almost 2 800 transactions in 2000 This doesn 01 t include an y of 20 our shipping business I hope this helps and please let me know if you have any other questions

type out a response I hope it helps 1 It was a matrix organization The IT personnel reported into the Global Tech group but we did that for communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control They attended business unit staff meetings and the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant feedback It was vitally important for the customer to be happy and that the IT person completed the projects from the BU When it came to the review process itself GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated 2 When Enron Net Works was formed nothing really changed on the day to day working of the IT world IT Global Technology was folded into the newly created 5th business unit at Enron Remember Global Technology had more that IT alone We had an eCommerce commercial group a principal investments group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing around the world Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works He is in the office of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley CEO and Louise Kitchen the newly appointed COO Both LK and GW are non IT people There are many VPs on the next level that are IT executives 3 In a nut shell Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience and title as CEO with Enron s goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the world He chuckled and said something like That sounds like Enron it always looks at things differently He then stated that my CEO title and Enron s approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place soon as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize it and change its culture 4 When i used the word cannibalize I meant that if we didn t change the business ourselves than our competition would do this for us For example we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it for free Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was going great We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that Gary I hoped that helped Please don t hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions Mike Gary Anthes Gary Anthes computerworld com on 10 06 2000 04 18 40 PM To Mike McConnell mike mcconnell enron com cc Subject Thanks and a few residual questions Hello Mike Thanks for sending me those presentation slides They are good background And thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week It was most interesting and helpful I m confused on a couple of points so would you mind answering a few more questions 1 You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group you seeded people out into the business units and the way we did that is we had those people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head So at that point it was a sort of matrix organization with IT people dispersed thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT organization for things such as standards is that correct 2 Then this spring when Net Works was formed did those 1 500 IT people essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT organization Roughly how many non IT people and of what types are part of Net Works Two of the three top managers in Net Works are non IT from trading correct Does any given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT and to a business unit 3 For some reason my recorder messed up and I couldn t decipher what you said about Scott McNealy s reaction to your background etc at the breakfast Could you repeat that 4 You said We had to cannibalize our own businesses So what I think you ll see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different What did you mean by cannibalize our own business Thanks again Regards Gary Anthes Gary H

provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h 20 that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g 20 difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was 20 available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any 20 member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to 20 explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time 20 permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As 20 you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting 20 firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et 20 research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that 20 required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way 20 shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 20 years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s 20 begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are 20 actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns 20 until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example 20 Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first 20 year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t 20 in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for 20 spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last 20 year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January 20 February and offers were made in February and March The only school that 20 did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope 20 We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group 20 because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron 01 s ability to hire quality s ummer 20 interns This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts undergraduate and 20 40 summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of 20 summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful 20 assignments Approximately 85 of these individuals received permanent 20 offers to join Enron 20 The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate 20 summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire 20 undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs 20 particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms 20 that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron s competitors Because the 20 undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have 20 continued to have a special focus on these individuals i e the reason the re 20 were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about 20 which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your e mail y ou 20 indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r 20 provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken 20 therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained 20 from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson 20 o According to Cindy approximately 5 of companies actively recruiting on 20 campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy 20 attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring 20 or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct 20 all interviews at one time 20 o In conclusion Cindy estimated that 95 of companies actively recruiting on 20 campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he 20 statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such 20 information 20 It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably 20 different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the 20 individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for 20 the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be 20 different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve 20 that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are 20 supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are 20 already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview 20 process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in 20 most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by 20 the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would 20 like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this 20 fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to 20 support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your 20 frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her 20 manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f 20 you are having difficulty with members of the

Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our businesses achieve and exceed their goals In fact you will recall in communicating the changes in February we actually highlighted what we anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to maximise our effectiveness A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook priorities and objectives We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR services and advice More importantly the business has recognised us for the huge progress we have made to date This success is an outstanding achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of As is always the case at Enron continuous change is the norm and so as to illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA have over the last 2 months essentially been split into three Enron Global Markets set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously part of Enron Europe and CALME Coal Financial Tarding and Insurance Weather which were all previously part of ENA EGM is now led by Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman Enron Industrial Markets set up to focus on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial sectors which will build on the success of the Paper Pulp and Lumber business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market EIM is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen Enron North America remains the largest of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America including Canada and Mexico ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and John Lavorato Mark Frevert following his return from Europe has been instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each of these as well as Enron Europe which collectively now constitute Enron s entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re examine the HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly Fortunately our flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise have been In addition given the immense value and positive client feedback we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise skill lines this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and refine our efforts in developing market intelligence employment propositions compensation ideas and best practices as well as the innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro actively provide our clients with a competitive advantage I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self explanatory however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them either with your team leads or me Given that we have a staff meeting scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and answer any questions at that time Finally to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months I would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex our resources to anticipate meet and exceed our businesses needs This will clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward This is not Change for change s sake but change and our ability to change quickly and as often as necessary is essential for us to remain a competitive and

ECT Subject Hiring Practices for Summer Interns While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 2001 interns I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager Shelley Jones and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron s staffing When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley with no resolution When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns I volunteered to have James Scribner a Senior Director on my team obtain this market information Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data or were not sure how to do so They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions And based on this information I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting As administrators of the program you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two way messaging system I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell executive sponsors for UT and OU respectively they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you Please let me know how this can be resolved With the help of James Scribner and others we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways

3 4 x 10 3 8 inches 20 At the beginning of the 1940 01 s Matisse was starting to concentrate on th e 20 technique of using cut pape collages to create abstract color compositions 20 The dense smooth colors and clear cut shapes created a totally new artistic 20 language for him It was in seeking to extend this concept that he began 20 under the encouragement of the publisher Teriade to experiment with using t he 20 same types of form created through stencil printing At first he used cut 20 stencil shapes linked to lithography and then move to using the stencils 20 with pochoir color for this removed problem of lithography diluting the col or 20 intensity 20 Matisse 01 s project was to create an album titled Jazz forms expressed 20 through a brilliant highly emotional purity of vibrant color The first 20 trials were made using lithography and it was in this connection that the 20 Icarus composition above was issued by Teriade in Verve as a form of 20 publicity for the forthcoming album It is one of the great characteristic 20 images of Matisse 01 s oeuvre of this period 20 Image 2 20 Roy Lichtenstein American 1923 1997 20 8 500 00 20 COMPOSITION FOR THE SOLOMON R GUGGENHEIM

special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business unit heads receiving this message Jeff and I along with Bill Donovan would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning June 8th from 8 30 to 9 30 a m Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time Please contact Cathy Phillips at X 36898 if you plan to attend the tour New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name NH for new hire and an approximate hire date Example Bob Smith NH 7 25 Any space move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building The Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent phone with the existing phone numbers Please contact Jennifer Burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones All private team rooms offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations specific scheduling details to follow later 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room no videoconference 3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group Every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible At this time details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated It is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date more information will be provided related to food service deliveries and distribution Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments questions or issues to them via e mail They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday at 4 30 p m to meet with anyone to discuss their questions Please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible

in the process of discussing this with various people A couple of observations that have become clear and I want to pass them on to you Overall the size of the transaction is not going to fly If we brought in other players and significantly reduced our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal Rick Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been reconfirmed this morning I understand that the deal is very active and needs to move forward now but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we will not take the entire deal Last night George stated that he may not want to tell them that and I agreed But upon reflection I think that needs to be re addressed The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal potentially closed with these guys Also having them assist in bringing others to the table might be beneficial I ll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more Mike Daniel Reck 08 07 2000 06 34 PM To Mike McConnell HOU ECT ECT Jeffrey A Shankman HOU ECT ECT cc George McClellan HOU ECT ECT Subject draft Mike and Jeff Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week To reiterate the key commercial risk issues are 1 Tax Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the qualifications of the Pacificorp machines Thorough due dilligence will be required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling applications 2 Syndication Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find monetizers Ideally the monetizers would close when we do Realistically we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we can shed our ownership Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in as 25 owner which should reduce the bridge risk since we can show the former owner staying in the game 3 Operations The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the equity Post syndication the new owners can contract directly with an operator For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk We will guide the monetizers to this risk If we have to indemnify them in this area we will need to better understand the available insurance products 4 Marketing This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire The desk believes that the coal synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over the next 12 18 months We have put 6 00 ton into the model and the desk will buy 3 00 ton today for seven years The current market is anywhere from 1 00 3 00 ton We have also developed a list of strong sites that are looking for machines three of which we control either through options or marketing agreements The economics of the deal are compelling We put out 100mm to Pacificorp as an equity bridge maybe less if they stay in as 25 owner We collect 30 50mm in commodity spread origination and another 30 50mm in equity origination Commercially the deal makes sense and I am confident that we can structure around the risks The decision we need from senior management is whether this is a game we want to play The machines fit into the letter of the law Big companies AIG Florida Progress Detroit Edison etc have joined in the reindeer games We can put on the position we want by bridging this deal On the flip side people have heartburn over spirit of the law issues and those are questions that senior management has to decide We have a chance to move on these machines but need to make up our mind by the end of this week whether to put resources on it We can back out later our commitment so far is non binding but we can t get back in Please let me know your thoughts Regards Dan

equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of gas and electricity which can make significant contributions to our earnings growth We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in North America Europe and most recently in our new Net Works business unit Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products coal emissions insurance currency equity trading interest rates credit trading paper and pulp and metals While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America and Europe In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today announcing the formation of a new business unit Enron Global Markets This new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in scope but outside our traditional gas and power markets This new core business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with the North American and European businesses

though it will be a fire drill We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there it was just being held or managed in four places It will all be pulled together by Monday in one place one complete document and will have about 15 major categories with specific tasks under each category with status person responsible comments and date to be completed It will also have a complete timeline We can review that Monday and agree on its content Louise agreed to review it as well As it relates to the people you mentioned let me know how and or who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them Salley Beck called she mentioned you had called her as well and we agreed that the ClickPaper s back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July 24th Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to receive password applications create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency Remember we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified We also have a help desk person starting next week I don t have his name yet but we have him and one more on the way We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done We have a few holes but it is not that far away She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend Let me know what Mark Palmer says He knows we have been using Margaret We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing a letter that does not include temporary IDs passwords We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers we want to use this time to get them pre registered Besides there is no way to test a 1000 temporary IDs anyway We will send those out later as I said earlier the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area or garden as Lousie would call it by next for Friday or the following Monday That way people can surf the content and get registered On legal I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts what is needed and the deadline There is legal work left to do the current draft of the password application doesn t work but if Taylor can help that would be great We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy with Bob Crane and Hal as well to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it Credit is fine we have been working with Bradford for months but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday July 22nd for the final testing of the system Remember the 24th is a one Enron to many launch with a financial market only ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron s existing financial offering Later we will build it out for physical probably sooner rather than later Finally I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November It will only be many to many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case to do so Thanks See you tomorrow GP To Greg Piper Corp Enron Enron cc Subject ClickPaper com Greg a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday s meeting I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines personnel responsibilities and key action items I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments Andrew Parsons Sr Director and superior performer is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and I ve asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

points and action items tha t 20 were emphasized during my recent trips to South America Japan and Korea 20 Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n ow 20 truly gets the ENW story and what we are attempting to accomplish The 20 efforts over the past 8 months are really beginning to pay dividends This 20 is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and 20 discussed topics but rather a briefing of a few top priorities and items fo r 20 each group Enron South America I met with the entire management team as a group in Rio at an ESA board 20 meeting and most of the key individuals separately Sugar coffee and orange juice were new commodities that were brought up by 20 numerous groups as consideration for new ENW efforts due to their desirable 20 market characteristics Pulp and Paper additional activity has already begun and is currently bei ng 20 worked with Greg Piper I believe that this is the best and short term 20 opportunity out there Metals and mining is big in South America This was also brought up 20 frequently and I told D Arcy Carroll that we would get back to them upon 20 further closure of MG and that this could move quickly up the food chain bu t 20 not to focus as top priority yet D 01 Arcy former Cargill trader has strong connections at Cargill and 20 believes that we can go in compete and

is in a unique position to develop a huge busine ss 20 and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy 20 problem I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business 20 than most the other business units Enron Japan needs to use the internet to 20 educate and drive this new business to achieve the penetration it needs 20 without an incumbent position The competition and market characteristics 20 fit very well with our statements about ENW in our general presentations 20 Anthony Dayeo has just joined the team Between ENW providing a VP of 20 Anthony s

learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan This would be most helpful We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in Europe and in the US Faster quicker smarter Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday Is Anthony in japan during the trip Anthony was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive Remember I am not a technologist and therefore can t discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus of the business I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to Sherriff It is mostly up to date although continually changing This will help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like On Wed however I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into our overall strategy A couple of other questions about the trip Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans I don t think presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have something particularly appropriate The discussion with EPower EJ on Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what Enron is doing across the focus areas On Friday I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary For the ACCJ if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e comm initiatives this would be great We could put this together here if you would like as I have a couple of your recent presentations Let me know Also what is the appropriate dress code The Japanese still dress up I m afraid suits are de rigour I am assuming suits but i didn t want to make any assumptions about new cultures Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do s and don ts of both cultures We could try and find something but I think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western Despite what you have heard this place is not as foreign as rumored Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport All of us get back and forth on the train and the bus We can get you a driver but you won t get here any faster and is quite expensive US 500 one way I normally get a driver I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can t speak any of the language If there is a way to get lost I ll find a way One more item could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture Ono will set something set up here The hotel has its own massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours Thanks Mike Joseph P Hirl ENRON DEVELOPMENT 06 07 2000 07 25 PM To Mike McConnell HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Re Japan trip Mike We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here

initiatives within Net Works We would bring EJ over to EPower for your talk Afterwards we would have drinks with the main commercial team at EPower and EJ Dinner to be arranged for a smaller group On Friday we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with key IT tech companies here in Japan To date we have not yet met any of these companies but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity in the country We are looking to leverage some of Enron s banking relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of Softbank We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks We are also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on Enron and Enron Technology The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest chambers in the

LON ECT ECT Subject J Block I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J Block has had problems meeting our nominations from the Judy Joanne Janice reservoirs Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May they were making up for reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they are entitled but not obliged to do Since return from outage at the end of May they have declined to nominate at the NBP From 1 January to 15 May the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept underdeliveries to 350 mmcf ie one day s maximum quantity in total Since returning from the maintenance shutdown underdeliveries have totalled 850 mmcf averaging 77mcf d We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the maintenance period they have decided to default on the contract rather than make up deliveries from other sources They have an effective cap on the penalties of about 5 pence per therm after taking into account the value of the liquids and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm Prior to the CATS shutdown we had made them a proposal to enable them to deliver additional volumes at another alternative to avoid default but they have not responded yet You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties This has cost us about 1 5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their non performance Perhaps a phone call by you might help By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if you need me for a phone call I can break away John

have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects They are lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that have recently come into the group have That is why we have brought them in We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn t done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team The biggest opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and books That certainly doesn t mean that 20 years of experience doesn t have enormous value especially in the non Atlantic markets Rick is in the process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east projects and strategy Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly he would like to do in the time of transition My very sincere hope is that he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role Especially in a big deal in Japan Korea or something in the Asian area We will discuss this next week when he comes to town I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island Venezuela and Bahamas immediate activity He will certainly be engaged in everything but he can not be focuses as much as you

the Residential Construction Contract Mr Kent intends on using in connection with the construction of your home Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost Plus Contract Therefore we spoke with him about this matter He indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus basis no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston Builders Association form which is for the most part a good one although it is written primarily to protect the builder Therefore we may ask that a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in the indemnity language In addition there may be some other changes we request Under any circumstance we can dictate a letter to Mr Kent at the appropriate time Mr Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home itself When you close Flair Construction Co Inc will also have to provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the Subcontractors Flair intends on using We are sure that the construction lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate time Should you have any questions or comments please call us

conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility If we had 1 3 of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels notional or about 14 million barrels PV At 5 our exposure would still be 5 million notional or 2 3 million PV According to John he would not be comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 2012 Given these comments I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time As far as the economics of the deal are concerned we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high and

DEVELOPMENT Subject Re Jose LNG Off take Comments Eric thanks for your comments Please see below in blue our observations and answers Let s talk later today if you have further questions Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec 31 2004 We will add to this list the earlier of something like the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90 of its capacity for a period of 10 consecutive days We suggest putting something like this as opposed to commercial hand over because this is in the plant s contractor s control and they could for example on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for 4 months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we as offtakers can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow directly or indirectly under the project s control We have 4 months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC or another EPC Contractor already built in Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18 We agree that would be better but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA because they don t want us to sell down and then keep controlling new LNG businesses in Jose They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA We think that adding a restriction to the asset s returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause Thus jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions We never intended to use these off take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes Nevertheless we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation We did not include it now on purpose We will include it when ever they remind us to do so We want to have another fight about the bonus Where is the min price The minimum price is in We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number We are going to try to do it but that is first a GSA issue and we don t want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics No we don t have the definitive answer from structuring yet but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba Brazil power plant we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient But since we don t have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting that should have been bracketed in the term sheet though and it will Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch Yes we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as off taker and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue The exporter of record will be the project so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela In addition the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer Although a large portion of the underlying risk is always there Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LD s in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better New York law provides for full market based damages market price of commodity plus extra costs which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause So from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is We are still discussing w Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better GSA default is market based provided that PDVSA as we expect accepts the change we will propose so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time say 36 months we need time to give you precision on this but some sort of coverage will be available suppose the plant produces 5 less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry Under the off take agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3 lower than expected On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible meaning a lower LNG volume This volume is 5 lower than the guaranteed production with Normal or expected feed composition Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is 8 lower than the expected production with expected feed On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10 above what was expected mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity holders whole They don t provide though for damages payable under off take contracts nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs However as we explained we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption as we already did What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials It sets however a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the reasonable constant deliveries provision damages will be payable based on prices during such month Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable Nevertheless short periods weeks of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard although we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected Our model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service which should be plenty The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages not BI are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons The question that follows is if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted If this is so are the banks going to be willing to live with this probably not insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off taker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause They point out also that 90 of LNG contracts are done in this

Jose LNG Off take Comments Enron Offtake Agreement Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18 Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation Where is the min price I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate Is this your intent to have a mismatch you have all new taxes being borne by the project company Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue Other where are the LD calculations explained I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default GSA default should match LD s in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery suppose the plant produces 5 less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems not a FM issue at commercial hand over What happens under the offtake agreements Will the banks accept this revenue short fall Will we have to create a reserve This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved what compensation do the offtakers get do the banks suffer here as well Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established Is this in your model insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling insert termination section put something in about

the PRC performance review committee for all of it s employees Enron ranks all of it s employees 2 times a year The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance The criteria for the rankings comes from a person s accomplishments characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking that feedback primarily from the business unit is a key driver Plus there are business unit reps on the PRC 3 I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage It was a very customer driven internal and external customers process

negotiate with us on an exclusive basis for the sale of the 4 synfuel machines they currently own and operate in Alabama Pacificorp advertises that each machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1 5 2 0 mm tons for a total of 6 8 mm annual tons We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale We will obviously require one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a single monetizer to be the lead otherwise we may end up facing conflicting demands from each monetizer Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100 of the equity in the machines while we provide the sites coal supply and synfuel sales We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators while not taking any operating risk ourselves Given the lease issue surrounding the Sempra deal we need to make sure we structure Pacificorp and AIG as a mtm deal We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites and is starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site The sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky We expect to finalize Sempra this week 2 machines on an accrual basis Team Synfuel will then focus their activities on AIG 3 machines and Pacificorp 4 machines in order to close at least one of the deals by the end of October Our goal remains to secure 4 6 machines by the end of the year

will be a very valuable resource to add to the team even if it is for a couple of weeks He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform He has others on his team that could help and I ve asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available some are working on ClickPaper already Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run Beth Pearlman John Tollefson IT Bob Schultz LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out Dave Forester not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out Mary Solmenson Scott Mills Berry Pearce David Port David Sweeny Sally Beck advice and discuss additional resources I did ask Louise to jump in and i know you did too to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they or the simplified early versions are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper I went by to see Mark Palmer he was out and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out or assigning John Tollefson and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective A few thoughts see you tomorrow mike

this company and its ideals programs and its commitment to excellence all of which I have seen since I started work The most impressive thing to me however were the things you said about positive thinking goal setting and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk with the J C Penney Leadership Program These are beliefs which I have been raised on by my father and really believe to be true It was very inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has obviously worked As I have started my internship here I am implementing this psychology into my life and work ethic and thought you would might have some helpful advice I know you are an extremely busy man but I decided to send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could

Fitzgerald Corp Enron ENRON Allan Sommer Corp Enron Enron cc Ellen Fowler HOU ECT ECT Drew Ries HOU ECT ECT Subject InfrastructureWorld com Memo from Larry Izzo Please read the attached memo from Larry Izzo He is obviously wanting to resurface Infrastructure World As you will note in the last paragraph he is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend 2 million on project management software development and that he can capture free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world On the surface of it this does not make sense on several dimensions 1 It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend 2 million on project management software development By definition such software would want to be collaborative and I don t understand the logic of why we would do it ourselves 2 If there is a seperate carve out of project management software that is required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of Cepren Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing we may have an opportunity to do joint development with any of these players The question is picking who we think would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done Allan and Drew together with the EECC have orchestrated meetings next week with these three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together with one of them I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other alternatives 3 It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend 2 million for Project Management software development although I am skeptical From an investment perspective there has not been that much that has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks The principal change has been a significant revaluation and critical assessment of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models I would thus say that two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel Hull involvement that there was a 75 ability to do legitimate VC at 5 to 10 million pre money as opposed to the 15 million that it was done at I would say that the probability would be 25 of 5 to 10 million with significant risk of doing subsequent rounds I would thus have a view that we should pass from an investment perspective I have left Larry a voice mail that I am available to meet when I am back Thursday and Friday when I am back from my father s funeral I will have a discussion along these points I am on vacation next week but told Larry in the voice mail that the alternative is to meet with Allan who is out this week and one of the people from my team

Don t be surprised if he calls you you are the master of this deal Mike Richard Harper 06 07 2000 09 30 AM To Mike McConnell HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Re J Block I have not been involved but only last week a little bird told me that they have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002 when we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount Agip is particularly adversely effected as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the area I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the squeeze down of Texaco and OMV the other Jade owners by Agip to sell their gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the same absolute level as in the old agreement so I believe they are 40 of the new price my memory is fading also I do recall that they all insisted that they would deliver the gas However as with most companies the players have all moved on and a contract is a contract afterall this was our approach Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J Block and did not forsee a shortage of production It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to co operate they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet As to opportunity if they are short of reserves perhaps they can buy themselves out of the situation especially while the contract is in the money With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the appeal courts This is probably nearest to the truth I m afraid this isn t much help and I do not recall any willful default provisions in the agreement Richard Mike McConnell 07 06 2000 14 49 To Richard Harper LON ECT ECT cc Subject J Block Richard Hello from South America I am forwarding this

our conference call on Monday that J Block has had problems meeting our nominations from the Judy Joanne Janice reservoirs Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May they were making up for reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they are entitled but not obliged to do Since return from outage at the end of May they have declined to nominate at the NBP From 1 January to 15 May the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept underdeliveries to 350 mmcf ie one day s maximum quantity in total Since returning from the maintenance shutdown underdeliveries have totalled 850 mmcf averaging 77mcf d We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the maintenance period they have decided to default on the contract rather than make up deliveries from other sources They have an effective cap on the penalties of about 5 pence per therm after taking into account the value of the liquids and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm Prior to the CATS shutdown we had made them a proposal to enable them to deliver additional volumes at another alternative to avoid default but they have not responded yet You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties This has cost us about 1 5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their non performance Perhaps a phone call by you might help By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if you need me for a phone call I can break away John

directly the benefits of the project and the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project We have alreday done this several times but it is time to do it again I recommend a visit in

HOU ECT ECT cc Subject Weather deals As discussed with Mark I have set up a summary of what we did to get people interested in weather trading at the Marketing event that we had here in Oslo Background First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading Could we do any deals that evening We invited them because they should start doing deals with Enron Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do weather deals Lottery We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal But we made the option premium to 15 Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100 NOK Our counterparties should not loose a lot of money so they paid the premium upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options The counter parties that were the traders and not the companies did their first weather deals with Enron It was important that the traders could go short or long or both Buy both put and call for the traders that was afraid of their possitions Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt that they traded weather deals The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that have done weather deals already Enclosed Lottery weather contract Deal Guest list

Subject EGM all company meeting Ken Per my voicemail we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food we expect about 500 people We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability We had a record Q1 with 100 million of gross margin That was 50 of what they made in all of 2000 Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made 87 million in gross margin I believe it will have a big impact If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance Mike
