ensure compliance with requirements of the F G 3 Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall Pipeline Safety Division There were 8 city county state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines This is the only agency approval received as yet Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary acreage for the Rogas project This is a major plus for the project The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in Az was received Some changes will be made in each document as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of the

Concerns","message_id":"<7909843.1075851920245.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_body":"Terry the entire facility has not been disturbed Only most of it Id say approx 70 The other 30 has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation just foot and vehicle traffic I dont have problem with saying the above but keep in mind the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine It has always been Transwetern s policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value scenery wildlife etc I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 for vegetation and soils I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats In addition the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore would not be an issue of habitat loss There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area I seriously doubt it Again TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose In Arizona we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction or from a drinking well source In any event we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe If we need to discuss the above give me a call Hackett Terry THackett ENSR com on 03 09 2001 02 18 52 PM To Larry Campbell enron com Larry Campbell enron com cc Donna Martens enron com Donna Martens enron com Subject Station 2 Concerns Larry I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of concerns regarding the environmental report The report is being written based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard and on previously disturbed ground If we impact areas even within existing facilities that were not previously disturbed we are required to include environmental data about those areas So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been previously disturbed To help determine this I downloaded a USGS aerial 1996 of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the station yard look to be the same age size as those surrounding the station This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees have not been previously disturbed A copy of the aerial is attached However it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial construction and the trees simply grew back Unfortunately I don t have that information and don t know if you do either And let me point out that my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct but the amount of information supplied in the report I want to feel comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC For this project that would primarily include a description of the existing vegetation and soils resource report 3 and 7 All we would really need is a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils and how much will be permanently impacted etc However we did not budget any time to obtain this information nor did we anticipate the need for site visits My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously disturbed or not If not I hope to come up with some verbiage that everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements Otherwise we will have to obtain the necessary information and that s beyond our initial scope If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects that may provide enough information Again it only needs to be brief Also we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in previously disturbed areas Lastly Arnold has indicated that the hydro test water will come from existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under Transwestern s blanket permit Please verify and I think we should provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing After you have had a chance to think about this please call and we can discuss Terry Station 2 aerial jpg The information contained in this communication is confidential and

conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the Koch office were reviewed Assumptions were made that the environmental records were complete for all assets included in the sale Primary emphasis was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of crude oil In particular pipeline and tank farms were the most critical assets which were reviewed Based upon the data review the Koch assets were in compliance with the following Air permitting permit by rule standard expemtions recordkeeping and fee payments were documented NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks were documented Oil Pollution Act OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date SARA compliance and reporting had been completed SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112 Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were available for review There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site included in the asset for sale permits for the remediation activity is in place Hazardous waste notifications annual reportings and fee payments were documented Based upon the above review there were no issues which could be identified which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a considered a major environmental liability This statement is again based upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the data room for the assets in question It should also be stated that this analysis of Koch s environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase a recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to each location to verify findings from the records review Also due to the past history of Koch s operating practices it is recommended that contract conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which

Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion In the 1996 meeting with the AQB Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505 It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by

2000 This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility Because VOC s are the issue I asked him what the emissions were for VOC s on the 1999 inventory Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19 50 tons yr actuals and 33 56 tons yr potentials We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility Craig Willoughby of Entrix had requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future In speaking with Kevin he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton yr limit on VOC s or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101 10 emissions inventory requirements and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton yr VOC emissions

the vessel I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else Tiny do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG E As you know they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA but with the new PCB rules in place a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities How do you think PG E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other

will take a close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts are on there Now about item 5 and your closing paragraph Item No 5 I do not want to open the issue of the PCB Model to PG E at this time Maybe later but not now As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph Randy Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators deconned We took great pains last fall when we had the separators down to test and decon them so we could establish a base line Why would we take the system down and change the filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility If we did that then hypothetically next fall 2002 when we took the system down and changed the filters if we took any wipe samples it could contain residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past twelve months It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up I m open to further argument on it but that is the way Randy and I see it at this point in time On the subject of the selection of the contractor Randy and I believe that you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best job and is most dependable Remember that PG E had confidence in Vector at least that is what I recall from last fall So if we go with a new consultant will PG E have the same confidence Also you and Tiny must make certain that the firm we use has some acceptable credentials What PCB issues have they handled in the past

message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us As you may know Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch team advisor in the Flagstaff area of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management State of Arizona State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there appears to be trouble on the horizon John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would like to take a more proactive approach up front with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway As for the for the environmental studies you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest Once the pipeline corridor is identified and staked surveys will need to be completed for the following threatened and endangered plants and animals archeology surveys for bones artifacts relics etc noise surveys should this portion of the project require installation of horsepower The FERC will require an EIS environmental impact statement and environmental report to be conducted These activities include not only the environemntal issues but also things like socioeconomics land use soils geology etc Past consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this greatly expidites the process John has eluded to this previously Due to the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount for the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire proposed right of way 140 miles from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be walked and surveyed by several people I would rather wait until we can identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a figure However because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate I would recommend an amount of 70 000 to 90 000 for the baseline environmental work and this might be a little light in the event the surveys identify something please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at this time Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assist in the environmental budgeting for this project From Kevin Hyatt ENRON enronxgate on 07 25 2001 10 55 AM CDT To Larry

which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the TNC and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona I think we will have a better handle on

Company-Summary","message_id":"<3909100.1075851921960.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_body":"As per your request an environmental due diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company NWNG a local distribution company LDC with its corporate headquarters located in Portand Oregon This due diligence which was conducted on August 7 9 2001 was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue A relative risk number between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact A rating of 0 indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of 3 indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair remediate or formally close each issue Presented below by discipline are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records documents and discussions with NWNG personnel Therefore this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented General Pipeline Characteristics This is a dry pipeline system No pipeline liquids are generated only small volumes of compressor oils are collected All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system There is still approx 100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage and underground injection and storage reservoir 10 5 bcf storage capacity this is a non Title V major source NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 2002 All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas Environmental Procedures Manual The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with The manual addressed waste management permitting disposal and environmetal stewardship There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG s commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG Risk 0 Cost 0 Notices of Violation NOV Notices of Noncompliance NON In a summary page provided by NWNG a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available Although the company had received a few notices 10 they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues There were no outstanding judgements NOVs NONs or pending agency actions or issues to be resoved Risk 0 Cost 0 PCBs In interviews with NWNG they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system was unknown Risk 1 Cost 0 Mercury Mercury was used on the NWNG system but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in 1986 87 to remove mercury manometers An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used Risk 1 Cost 3 000 40 000 Onsite Disposal Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants in interviews with NWNG s environmental management they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous toxic or non hazardous waste Risk 1 Cost undefined Hazardous Waste There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste Risk 0 Cost 0 NORMS The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials NORMS are not a problem in the pipeline system Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest Pipeline Company Risk 1 Cost 500 Underground Storage Tanks UST There is only one regulated underground storage tank UST remaining on the NWNG system Albany and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring testing and recordkeeping All other underground tanks have been removed At one of the tank removal sites there exists an active remediation in progress Closure of this site is expected in the near future Risk 1 Cost 500 LNG plants In interviews with NWNG environmental management there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas LNG plants The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant Linnton site which underlies the LNG plant This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant Risk 0 Cost 0 Manufactured Gas Plants NWNG owned and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks Eugene Water and Electrical Board The City of Eugene has determined that a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of 1958 1976 The Eugene Water and Electrical Board EWEB which is the regulatory agency in Eugene has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately 1 300 000 of which the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be 93 750 NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of 70 000 90 000 to be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene The environmental management of NWNG has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG offer of approximately 94 000 Risk 1 2 Cost 94 000 Salem Site According to NWNG management this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature Risk 1 Cost 0 Manufactured Gas Plant This site which ceased operation in the early 1900 s was dismantled and abandoned From the time the facility ceased operations untill the present a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park The site is immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River a major perennial watercourse in Oregon There have been no soil groundwater or river river sediment studies completed to determine potential environmental impacts NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of London The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site Risks 2 3 Costs 0 300 000 000 Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor on the Wilammette River has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the 6 7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site This superfund site extends for a distance of 6 7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites originally owned by NWNG The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary responsible parties which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination Linnton MGP Wacker Site The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site has 47 acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Linnton facility which originally included the Wacker Site initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956 During the operation of the facility operation various organic coal tar wastes comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids LNAPLs and dense non aqueous phase liquids DNAPLs were generated Characteristically these waste products include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs BTEX and cyanide During the early stages of facility operation these wastes were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River and then later in 1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette River were in excess of 4 6 million gallons or 23 000 cubic yards It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately 250 000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar ponds Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more years NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG s portion of this superfund responsibility The policies were not availble during the due diligence to verify or confirm the amount of coverage Additionally because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated It should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known adequate insurance coverage appears to be somewhat premature Risk 3 Cost 50 000 000 300 000 000

expansion for C S 3 and 4 The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed I told the engineer that becasue C S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA As you remember the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue He advised me not to do this I think his decision had something to do with the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues Im a little

the ADEQ is completing the review and permit writing This way I wont step on any toes By the way the ADEQ said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue The following time line for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be another 2 3 weeks to write the permit one month by the ADEQ technical staff to do the required internal review and then the EPA is given a one month period to do their review which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 permit applications in Arizona Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week I might be able to set a meeting up with the

Larry Campbell 20 had 01 received a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e 20 meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday 01 The 20 strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California 20 political lawyer type 01 who would have the necessary contacts to get us in 20 there and get the permits moving 01 Lou agreed and we have been working o n 20 that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct 20 that could get this job done 01 I personally have had lengthy discussions 20 Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey 20 consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and 20 California 01 We are closing in on a 01 local law firm and also a high le vel 01 air 20 consultant 01 who will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief 20 level 01 to present 1 our 01 situation 2 clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA 20 and 3 how long these permits have already been on file 01 We should hav e 20 someone identified early this next week 01 20 01 Let me present the following information to 01 complement yours 01 The permitting timeline 01 being used 01 was based on historical 20 timelines 01 encountered 01 while processing prior Arizona projects 01 No indication 20 of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning 01 A familiar consultan t 20 Argent 01 was used for the air permit applications and no indication was 20 offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not 20 occurring 01 Applications filed in March 2001 and by letter from the age ncies 20 were deemed complete by mid April Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e 20 applications for Station 1 and 2 has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng 20 on the applications as they are in the que 01 He told Larry Campbell a nd I 20 have verified 01 it also by talking to outside consultants that permit in 20 Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in 20 getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to 20 AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a third party contractor to 20 take the permits and work them up 01 for release to the publishing firm so they 20 can be sent out for public comment 01 AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd 20 discuss our applications 01 01 Even if we get this part going this is only 20 part of the problem 01 Bottom line is 01 we must play our cards 01 correc tly at this 20 juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and 20 out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after 20 that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story 01 It is most difficult to put press ure 20 on them more so than AZ DEQ 01 The applications for Stations 3 and 4 are on 20 tribal land and these 01 applications are not delegated to any state air qu ality 20 department 01 01 After the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made 20 a couple of calls 01 to the Permit Engineer 01 in Region IX and received a negative 20 response 01 Larry was told that the 01 permits would issue in one to four months 20 and that 01 there was no need for a meeting with them 01 Again 01 my adv ice at this 20 point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high 20 level and get the meeting set 01 It s one thing to pressure the State of 20 Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l 20 with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devil s 20 permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching 01 20 Again we must first get a personal meeting with them 01 to enable us to 20 present 01 the need circumstances and how long these permits have already been 20 on file 01 Locating the 01 correct person to help us do that is of upmost 20 importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility 20 to 01 review and publish not only the permits for Stations 3 and 4 but to also 20 review the AZ DEQ permits for stations 1 and 01 2 for 30 days 01 Therefor e if we 20 anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations 01 3 and 4 they could delay the 20 issuance of the permits for Stations 1 and 2 that 01 have been expedited wi th 20 the AZ DEQ 01 It s a two edged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very 20 carefully 01 Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a political lawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ 20 and EPA Region IX to help us get the 01 desired meeting with key 01 people in order 20 to 01 move 01 the permits 01 This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner e g funding a third party to get the 20 permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some strategic ideas that will increase the 01 probability that this type 20 of circumstance will not occur in the future 01 I will be glad to discuss any 20 of this with you on Monday morning 01 John

First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours 20 of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation 20 because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to 20 Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10 safety factor on all 20 applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not 20 triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that 20 they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that 20 they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he 20 time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need 20 some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g 20 it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic 20 converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g 20 with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e 20 PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l 20 technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit I know 20 time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and 20 4 but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lb hr 20 or ton yr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK 25 ppm vd 20 for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at 20 lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60 the manufactures numbers are 20 40 ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we 20 stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20 of the time and we 20 applied a 15 safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented 20 this in lb hr and tons yr This would have covered us but because the 20 permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads 20 and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit 20

the period of time that the permit is valid then were ahead of the game If not and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit Usually the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility From Jerry D Martin ENRON enronXgate on 11 15 2001 05 33 PM CST To John Shafer ENRON enronXgate Larry Campbell ET S Enron ENRON cc William Kendrick ENRON enronXgate

probably reported to you by now the public hearing last night in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result Shudeish had copies of the draft permits which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory Apparently about three weeks ago Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as Section Manager Compliance to take a position with a consultant CH2M Hill which is trying to start an air group in Arizona I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the comment period this was announced at the hearing to allow mailed comments postmarked on Friday Nov 23 to reach DEQ He then said that he expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week by Nov 30 he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits but that was not problemmatic Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues and that did not seem to be any difficulty I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment period opened by first publication on October 17 The public hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication and that is why it was set for Nov 19 Thus even allowing for a couple of days after what should have been the close of comment period Nov 19 because Nov 17 was a Saturday the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than the end of the week Shudeish said he would check and get back to me I know this is only a couple of days difference assuming the permits are issued by Nov 30 but I am sensitive to Jerry s urgency to get moving quickly and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance starts dragging

activities in California On a similar note while speaking to Ralph Komai PCB person for SoCal some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles we know that liquids are not being sent inot California Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system it appears the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas SoCal will be meeting with PG E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG E The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm The location of this interconnect is near Bakersfield Ca Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal As you know Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest The price of the 2 separators will be approx 33 000 plus installation charges Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002 Of note Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which

downstream of their first C S Topock and on out west toward their main distribution areas With respect to the most recent sampling data Low PCB concentrations N D to 38 ppm have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock and Hinckley C S The good news is that PCB s have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx 160 miles from the Topock C S PG E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6 1 00 Now for the bad news At the conclusion of the meeting PG E has stated that they want their Topock C S decontaminated This includes all piping and equipment I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB s from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system Additionally the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations Even with this they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned Preliminary estimates range to approx 3 5 million I think that this is only the tip of the iceberg If they are successful with this action the pipeline system will be next Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe valves etc Ill keep you informed on this

maintenance activities Should any of the above activities release natural gas in excess of 119 mscf a written notification should be faxed to the Regional Office of the TNRCC within the following timeframes Unanticipated Upsets within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset Maintenance Startup or Shutdowns 10 day prior to the expected exceedance This reminder is being sent to all ET S teams within Texas because in the last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the TNRCC they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 mscf The agency s inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor station venting for ESD start ups and shutdowns It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the TNRCC s position regarding this issue However until a position has been adopted by Enron s GPG I am recommending that each facility comply and report as appropriate The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows Midland 915 570 4795 Included facilities Wt 2 Walton Keystone Lone Star Valero Spraberry Seminole Lubbock 806

will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PG E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PG E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe 2 Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP 353 kettleman C S latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley C S Line 311 is a 12 in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed 22 ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG E s biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB s Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of 1 3 ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free 3 Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PG E system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PG E to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PG E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks 4 Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter Separators Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority 1 sites The determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria 1 a location where liquids were collected twice and 2 ppm concentration of the liquids collected was 1 0 ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is 300 500 mmscf day Samples collected at this location have shown PCB s in the range of 1 4 ppm PG E s agreement with SoCal at this location is 1 0 ppm PCB s in the liquid phase PG E has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PG E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PG E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCB s at their interconnect locations 5 Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter Separators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PG E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for 16 sites with back up to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of 45 filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume F S up to the 29 indicated at the last meeting is 1 2 to 1 3 million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PG E presented One PG E customer a cement plant has inquired about PG E deconning portions of their plant that has PCB s PG E is in discussions with the cement company PG E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a 2001 project 6 Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PG E C S to study lube oil systems There are 22 compressors at the Topock and Hinkley C S s Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle 7 Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January 2000 rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PG E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250 300 mmscf day cap by May 15 Over time PG E will look into their C S configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf day 8 Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in 45 days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as some of the PG E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on other business

this afternoon regarding several issues 1 Ms Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division which is lead by a fellow named Mr Rizvi Mr Rizvi had contacted Ms Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the next semiannual sampling event This event is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 19th I am to notify Ms Bernacik when we have set a firm date for sampling 2 Ms Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off site access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional wells I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had picked it up but I wasn t certain I followed up with Norm and he has picked up the permit Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th 3 I asked Ms Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST removal Ms Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue Ms Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr Moreno s letter At a minimum the Pueblo will require continued monitoring This does not change our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program However Ms Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two additional monitor wells in the former UST area 4 I asked Ms Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area Ms Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW s request to close the landfarm I asked again about backfilling the excavation but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the excavation rather than closure of the landfarm I reviewed the letter from Ms Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically address backfilling the excavation I believe that Ms Bernacik is under the impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation if we still want to get this in writing it may be best for Norm to visit with Ms Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need

potential to pay lower emissions fees should this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly lower than what was placed into the permit application The downside to this

months ago With repsect to the other NOV issue Rick Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today As the testing contractor began his testing an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to Rick As a result the the inspector observed elevated CO readings from the heater that Rick had made adjustments in the heater set points based upon recommendations from the contractor causing the elevated CO readings to result The

potential risk if we do not follow up properly especially given the history of this plant with this Air District that is the Koch troubles that resulted in a criminal investigation from some relatively minor problems really In fact I believe that if we act promptly and conduct the source test now we stand a very good chance of having this NOV rescinded But we must act I am please to see that we still have Gary on the job and I hope he can follow through with this I have asked him to do so and also to handle reporting of the soil contamination at NCL that we have all discussed at

things He seems to feel that he should be getting direction from Cutty Cunningham although I must confess I don t know enough yet about the structure of ETS to know why this is the case In any event I asked Gary to talk to whomever he needed to but these matters needed to be handled in the short run Obviously we will discuss next week what is to be done for the long run In the meantime I would

the PCB remediation at C/S 6","message_id":"<20071939.1075851919720.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_body":"I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo the PEOP a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico ranging from UST to superfund and members of ETS 5 members of the Laguna team Butch Russell Rick Smith advisor for the Laguna team myself and George Robinson This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo The meeting centered around two issues at the site the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity With respect to the first concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis and send the results to POEP for review With repsect to the PCB remediation issue things were a little different The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern s attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination but based upon the historic sampling results that this technology is not proving to be very successful in fact the results have shown stagnant results Im using their words They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site Members of the Laguna pueblo who work for the POEP expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a cancer with potential to spread A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University Energy and Environmental Research Center who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done At the conclusion of the meeting I informed the POEP that Transwestern s internal remediation group would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions This seemed to satisify the POEP and they were content with this John I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue A couple of things I want to bring out First we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future Second on the Laguna tribal lands they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem Although we are considered by the POEP as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with direct quote from the POEP they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from Transwestern to clean up the PCBs Please get back with me on this ","recipient_address":"john.shafer@enron.com, louis.soldano@enron.com,

have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two C S on state lands Ive dealt with these individuals before but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that After that meeting I will decide who should do the applications I have calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands Pending the outcome of each meeting I will decide who to use Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits and they would probably be my first choice I am keeping Mr Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units which will be permitted for a six month period there will still be an overall major emissions decrease After the six month period the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again Also my intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system If this was a new station I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 45 number but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine this should be easy to do The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can do but has had trouble reaching One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations By permitting at 45 ppm this will greatly help this Ill share the emissions numbers with you when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F 1 document for the FERC submittal and have been feeding him data

may keep me afloat Well see Anyway as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important family and health I know Ill come through all of this Sorry to hear that there is the word reorganization in Hess this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive I hate this kind of stuff I know that change is inevitable but so disruptive Ill keep you in prayer Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God that He can handle all our problems Keep the faith my friend and focus on the eternal Just like Peter wrote were just pilgrims in a foregin land waiting for the trip home and promise of Christ s return ","recipient_address":"'king@enron.com,

under the most dire and seemingl y impossible situations God is in control Its His promise that He will n ever leave us nor forsake us That in itself is a real comfort and securi ty knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times Whe n you get some time read Romans 8 28 and then meditate on it So many tim es we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son sometimes He has to e mpty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill u s with blessings that glorify Him Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us God s promise in Romans is to work ever ything including a job loss to His glory If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven then life on earth b egins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very tem porary I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation o f God s work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your Christian walk I will keep my ears open for any employment opportuni ties 20 When you re feeling down and discouraged drop me a line Sharing Christ w ith someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations In Hebrews were told to encourage the brethren I would consider it an honor

and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank Because WT 1 is a mainline compressor station any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank Within the past few years we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt 1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern Chemicals which producers and processing upstream of Wt 1 have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal Unfortunately there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials Based upon this I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into
