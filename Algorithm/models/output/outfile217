IS in GVA therefore no checking needs to be done 3 Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement if necessary for negative volumes to the TBS We have talked with IT and this would be a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system 4 Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the TBS connected to NNG 5 Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including End User point volumes would be housed in PGAS After further discussions in Gas Logistics our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a negative number If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen 1 Measurement should either a Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end user point higher than their TBS b Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk and Jodie will call LDC with the same info 2 If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close then measurement will use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point Gary and Ellis you may want to have more discussions on this topic I would be glad to regroup if you want I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue Also Raetta and Jodie are going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be greater than the TBS Hopefully it is just a measurement error We will let you know the outcome If there

with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1 Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW 1 SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems And they will maintain 750 for a gas day during all cycles Good news for TW 2 SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750 If they do they will maintain that capacity for a gas day during all cycles unless there are specific operational problems Good news for TW 4 SoCal will have the option to call OFO s at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins Starting Nov 1 they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day This will be a major impact to SoCal s customers 5 SoCal says the windowing is gone But they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity 6 SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation This would be due to SoCal s market not burning their schedule At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn Overall our process does not change If you

deliveries then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups at 8 00 a m at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC 3 If these deliveries are on Firm contracts can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes even though they are in the field area 4 Richfield Storage point I am not sure it is even active Could we get Oneok to agree to allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas

least one positi on Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed not only for her expertise in allocations and scheduling but in her partic ipation in holiday weekend coverage Jamie s participation in the holiday weekend coverage will also be missed Of course their daily presence in h andling the telephone calls and participation in team responsibilities are also missed Since our team rotates the evening position in order to distr ibute that responsibility throughout the nine schedulers we will miss Rut he and Jamie s participation in that as well this amounts to approximate ly five weeks annually each With the reassignment of their evenings along with holiday weekend coverage we are basically looking at a rotation of o nce every third weekend In the interim we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the sug gested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie s accounts We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we look forward

and the system would not allow it I pulled up POI 78163 only to discover that it was not a legitimate POI on N NG and that POI 401 was a receipt POI only I then went to Gary Spraggins to verify if their was a POI that NGTS could delivery gas off NNG for Pione er s compressor Received a call from Tim Green and Cindy White at Pioneer Gas Pipeline Comp any 915 655 3300 explaining Pioneer sent in an agreement form to create a new interconnect to take gas off NNG and mailed NNG a check to cover this expense I t went to Linda Trevino to see where we stood with this new ag reement Linda indicated that she had not activated POI 78163 as she did n ot have a reference contract I called Pioneer and they indicated that NGT S would be the only supplier at this POI I called Darren Brown at NGTS an d he informed me that he would be using contract 107903 to deliver gas to P ioneer s compressor starting 6 1 01 I gave the contract information to Li nda and she activated the POI and it defaulted to active confirmation I c alled Tim at Pioneer and asked him if active confirmation was what he rea lly needed and he indicated that he would prefer confirmation by exception I had him fill out NNG Request for Operator Choice Form and fax to me Linda changed the operator option for Pioneer to reflect confirmation by exception 20 Tim Green asked if they could set up an OBA at POI 78163 as the compressor would not necessarily use the 100 Dths nomed daily I had him send an e ma il request to Zula Carter and myself indicating POI 78163 be added to the O BA at POI 401 Gains County 2 This e

and the shippers at Mitchell CO2 have been aware of the pending sell of NNG assets to WGR since at least Jan 1 2001 All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned The OBA was not affected with this sell The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points They owe us 107 000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36 000 dth for fuel usage on the 5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year All that will be left on WGR s OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff Dan Ball and I are working together

the only two points in the group 4 If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated can Virginia Power switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing Answer The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from the field to the market

allocated at a different time Answer A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation When NNG looks at a storage allocation we review all the injections or withdrawals at the storage point The two referenced allocations are done seperately but during the same cycle 3 If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from Answer Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred 4 The storage that is offered by NNG s park and ride is at what location Demarc or Demarc Deferred Answer Demarc Deferred
