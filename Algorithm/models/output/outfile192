say that all of the schedulers are performing at a high level except for Hillary and Jan We have formally addressed Hillary s performance problems and he is on a schedule for improvement or he is out We have informally addressed Jan s performance issues with her and next week intend to formalize that also That Jan makes more than anyone else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes because we are not getting a return on that investment The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already aware of years of service years in scheduling level of performance etc In Stacey s particular case I am recommending her for promotion at the end of the year which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable with her job performance Also I intend to help smooth over other inequities through the bonus pool In regards to Patti I have recommended her for a bonus for her service during the rough time we ve had when we were understaffed Bob Superty has supported this and the information you provided him this last week should help in that endeavour Patti has had her pay increased this year after a salary survey was performed by our HR group I would like to point out that Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level Also Patti would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager I am not sure what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go I would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes on and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you and Mike still want to do As regards to the new hires yes we can hire more like these at these prices We would love to have employees like Matt and Ted and Shelly especially at these prices Patti did an excellent job hiring these individuals We have already started the process of looking for more like these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan We also need to hire more for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west We probably need to sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for expanding the desk Finally I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver office do all nominations for IM Denver deals This has met stiff resistance in the past and I do not know how ya ll feel about it but I promised that I would bring it up I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated from us if the operations were to move to Denver If you have additional questions or comments please let me know Thanks
