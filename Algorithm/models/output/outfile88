drive me nuts They come freaking out telling me something s wrong And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem Most of the time it s not even wrong they just don t understand the reports They finally announced that we re selling HPL today It s about time that that s actually going to happen You ll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately way more than any one person should have I m taking a GMAT review course We ll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career If not skip the next couple of sentences Shannon doesn t even know this yet She might have if she d quit blowing off our lunch plans I m going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year I ve talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting But I m going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me We ll see how that goes I m not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold I m not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview much less to live up there Has Shannon told you about the guy I m seeing She doesn t think he s too bright He didn t exactly make the best first impression on her He really is smart no matter what she tells you He s a super nice guy much nicer than me I know I know that s not saying much But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together We re always laughing and cutting up when we re together He s from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving but we were still just friends then It was pretty obvious that there was more there though We started dating the next weekend It s been kind of crazy though Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn t want everyone in our business we haven t told anyone we work with that we re dating So that s been pretty interesting No one s said anything yet but I know there are plenty of rumors going around It really wouldn t bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk Well my boss has walked

covering eyes and repetitive chanting of la la la la la la I m so disappointed but I won t be able to join you for the fun run on Thanksgiving I m headed home to see the family I really wish you were here right now You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate how irritating this guy that sits next to me is He just asked someone how Chi COG OOOO was How do you accent every syllable and then really drag out the last Unfortunately that isn t nearly the most irritating thing that he does I ll update you as he provides me with more stories As for the food in Australia it s really not all that different from here I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food They have a lot of American fast food chains The one that surprised me though was KFC it s everywhere It s a lot more popular there than it is here I guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a vegetable and they put beets on their hamburgers and they eat a lot of lamb Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here And they eat meat pies yuck The pastry is good on the pies but there s no flavor to the meat it s just greasy ground beef I think they still have a little too much of a British influence in their food they don t believe in seasoning I saw quite a few good looking guys There was a lifesaver training course going on at Bondi while I was there That provided some great scenery But then the problem is that the men don t realize when to stop wearing the speedos The young guys look good in them but after 30 they shouldn t be worn in public and after 60 they shouldn t even be considered as underwear under six layers of clothing but they especially shouldn t be worn on the beach I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn t even sure he had a suit on and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might see and for fear he d think I was interested Gotta go to a meeting Robin Mike Pitre pitre ev1 net on 11 13 2000

and Marion Jones run The whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday And the second week I spent touring all the beaches that I could find Oh here s a funny story for you Okay I m halfway across the world in a country known for bronze muscular sufers right So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters one day These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80 100 people As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise Here s the fun part 80 of the 85 people were from a WWII veterans reunion I was on a boat full of grandpa s Actually it was pretty funny This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war Then he tells me keep in mind this man s at least 70 that he was a lifesaver lifeguard on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire Then he starts telling me about the war He said Yeah I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren t feeding me very well so I left He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece where he joined the Greek reserve forces Because he fought with Greece in the war he s now a Greek citizen Then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia When they ran out of money they d just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they d start again I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people How s everything

must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark 2 With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS 3 GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex Power or Canadian books your book will not be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete 4 I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle These files must then be loaded into GRMS 4 I have to manually override Post IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly 5 The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete The more books that are officialized the longer the query takes 6 When books are unofficialized and reofficialized this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que This means that the entire process must be started over 7 Now that plugging positions is no longer an option I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position 8 If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem then I have to contact the GRMS support team Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me 9 I cannot query new data while I m researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to the information that is currently in the bench 10 Finally this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen

Lessons","message_id":"<18332509.1075858366892.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","message_body":" Lesson Number One A crow was sitting on a tree doing nothing all day A small rabbit saw the crow and asked him Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long The crow answered Sure why not So the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow and rested All of a sudden a fox appeared jumped on the rabbit and ate it Management Lesson To be sitting and doing nothing you must be sitting very very high up Lesson Number Two A turkey was chatting with a bull I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree sighed the turkey but I haven t got the energy Well why don t you nibble on some of my droppings replied the bull They re packed with nutrients The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree The next day after eating some more dung he reached the second branch Finally after a fortnight there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer who shot the turkey out of the tree Management Lesson Bullshit might get you to the top but it won t keep you there Lesson Number Three When the body was first made all the parts wanted to be Boss The brain said I should be Boss because I control the whole body s responses and functions The feet said We should be Boss as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go The hands said We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the money And so it went on and on with the heart the lungs and the eyes until finally the asshole spoke up All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss So the asshole went on strike blocked itself up and refused to work Within a short time the eyes became crossed the hands clenched the feet twitched the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss so the motion was passed All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit Management Lesson You don t need brains to be a Boss any asshole will do Lesson Number Four A little bird was flying south for the winter It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field While it was lying there a cow came by and dropped some dung on it As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung it began to realize how warm it was The dung was actually thawing him out He lay there all warm and happy and soon began to sing for joy A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate Following the sound the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate him Management Lessons 1 Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy 2 Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend 3 And when you re in deep shit keep your mouth shut ","recipient_address":"becky.pitre@enron.com","sent_time":"2000-06-22

put option and we charge for it so make sure you pay me premium The actual paperwork takes no time It could be done in a day Now if your question was the time that you can actually find a potential buyer well that really depends on how much you want for it Have you decided on a floor In other words decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago Prices for cars vary a little depending on the city So see if comparable cars in Chicago are selling for less that way it might be a good opportunity to try to sell it here SInce you don t have to sell it I would check the market very very well You don t need the money and you don t need to sell it You have the power If you decide to advertise it don t mention anything about

Charlotte NC man having purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars insured them against fire among other hazards Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having

company refused to pay citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion The man sued and won The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous He stated nevertheless that the man held a valid policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure against fire without further defining what would be considered to be an unacceptable fire and was obligated to pay the claim Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man 15 000 for the rare cigars he had lost in the fires And now the good part After the man cashed the check the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a 24 000 00 fine

order to properly represent originations on the NGP L 3 I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark 4 I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman Fletch and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information need only be queried once This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file 5 I updated the Greg Pos Report so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets 6 I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark 7 I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report I have not included any accomplishments from my former group If you would like to see them also please let me know Thanks
