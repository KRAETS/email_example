Dear John We have discussed the issues raised in the conference call today with our 20 Litigation Department and we have come to the following conclusions In order to assure that EPE will not loose its right to terminate the PPA we 20 suggest EPE to adopt one of the following solutions i send to Furnas the alternative letter which says that although the cu re 20 period is already over EPE based on the progress on the issues related to 20 the lender consent extends the 90 day cure period by another 30 days or ii send to Furnas the Notice of Intent to Terminate tomorrow and after t he 20 30 day consultation period extend such consultation period by another 30 20 days We believe that EPE should not send the Notice of Intent to Terminate witho ut 20 extending either the cure or the consultation period for the PPA and the 20 Brazilian legislation are not clear about the possibility of EPE to exercis e 20 its right to terminate the PPA after the 30 day consultation period Note that both solutions will only postpone the proceeding for EPE will ha ve 20 to decide whether it intends to terminate the PPA or not On the other hand we believe that there will be no termination process 20 without arbitration as Furnas and Eletrobr s have already denied the 20 occurrence of a causa de inadimplemento under the PPA Regarding the possibility for EPE to start the whole process again based o n 20 the same causa de inadimplemento we believe that this proceeding would b e 20 very fragile and could be challenged by Furnas and Eletrobr s As a result 20 we do not suggest you to adopt this alternative Finally according to section 24 XXII of Federal Law No 8 666 93 Furnas 20 may contract the supplying of electric energy without a previous bidding 20 process Regards Cl udia

br PGS Pedro G Seraphim pseraphim tozzini com br RKG Renata Kogut Gurevich RKG tozzini com br Subject RE PPA Notice of Intent to Terminate Attached is a revised draft notice which became more of a warning than a notice and which also was corrected as suggested by Guido Renno The PPA does not contain a provision stating the delay in enforcing a right should not be deemed a waiver of that right But also it does not require that the notice of intent to terminate be served right after the 90 day cure period Therefore we can wait to send the actual notice of intent to terminate A remark the cure period is of 90 days and not 120 It expires in the next couple of days if not already I am not sure what strength this warning could have maybe not much more than a threat I understand that starting the termination process is a very serious step with a lot of implications and I fully respect the decision of just sending the warning I would only ask whether this task would not be better achieved by informal contacts rather than a formal letter A small correction notices may be served by courts or by notaries but that is not required by law unless in specific circumstances The PPA does not provide for any formal notification procedure and thus there would be no need to do it by courts or notaries If you need to discuss any point on this document during Tuesday or Wednesday

the commercial operating period versus the construction period Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance coverage if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor action during commissioning on gas We are also advising the Lenders to have this point reviewed by an insurance advisor Degradation agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during commissioning During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of curves It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the benefit of Siemens We trust that your operations experts will diligently review the basis for the curves Performance LD s on gas per the EPC contract with first 4 000 000 forgiven by owner Please explain the rationale behind forgiving 4 million of Contractor LDs Delay LD s on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand down until 7 1 01 when gas is

of how long it takes the Contractor to commission on gas unless delays are attributable to Owner and re starts after Contractor has successfully completed the performance testing on gas Please confirm that our understanding is correct In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas if there are additional delays on the P L our Insurance group has indicated that we will have no

do that Also do we really want the Banks to say it is not fruitful to proceed with the consent Would it be better for the Banks simply to stick to their guns re the consent decline all of YPF s suggested changes and insist on their version of December 2000 That way YPF could be portrayed as partly to blame for failure to achieve a financial close by May 4 2001 It might help deflect the

update in regards to Doris Rodriguez s letter regarding the YPF Consent I have left a message for David Schumacher asking that he call me to Doris s letter Given the current status of things it would seem to me that there is no value in proceeding with the consent On the other hand we need to continue to build our case in the event of an arbitration with YPF It would seem to me that the best thing would be for the lenders to tell Doris that the lenders understanding is that under the current project schedule the conditions precedent under the YPF GSA cannot be satisfied and that Enron and YPF have had some discussions regarding this issue and will continue to discuss the issue Until the YPF GSA is restructured in some form there is little value in proceeding on the consent especially given that YPF and the lenders are still so far apart on the consent The status of the YPF consent is as follows Doris sent a revised draft of the consent to the lenders in August 2000 The lenders responded with comments which included several of my comments in October 2000 Doris then responded with a counter draft in December 2000 Doris latest draft again had numerous significant comments which I have not thoroughly reviewed A quick review however indicates that Doris has cut in half many of the time periods for the lenders to cure SCG defaults In addition Doris has restructured several provisions in order to make certain YPF commitments run in favor of SCG only and not the lenders which may be of no value to the lenders in a situation in which the lenders have to step into SCG s shoes I am confident that the lenders will not accept Doris s comments since many are proposals the lenders have rejected before Let me know whether I should suggest to Dave Schumacher a response to Doris along the lines I recommend Regards Dean CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE The information in this email may be confidential and or privileged This email is intended to be reviewed by only the individual or

about the l c before delivering it to them because they may require a bank s name that we don t have margin to work with right now Since there isn t any limitation on location of the l c bank on side letter or on the fuel contract we don t have any other options besides Arab Bank and its correspondent bank in Brazil If Petrobr s have any restrictions on the l c during our meeting or some days later when we will be delivering the l c we can argue that there was no restriction on location names of the l c bank on contract side letter and ask more time to obtain a new one or with another financial institution later Rick Rob We would like to have your opinion on this If you believe we should consult Petrobr s prior to deliver the l c I can talk to them and get their point of view on

NA Enron Enron Subject Re Letter Credit NY Bank Question Marcus Please have a look at the side letter and contract to see if there is any limitation on location of the L C bank ABN Amro had a local branch in Brazil so the R draws would have been relatively straight forward However with Arab Bank s New York Branch the way a draw would work is this Petrobras sends fax to Arab bank indicating a draw request Arab Bank will send funds to Brazil through its Brazilian correspondent bank and convert dollars to R There would be an FX trade and fee associated I assume that Enron would pick up the cost of this The one issue we need to consider is that any draw request would take approximately 24 hours as it involves a correspondent bank and FX trade Please confirm that Petrobras would not have a problem with this Regards Tracee Marcus Stephan ENRON 01 10 2001 08 34 AM To Tracee Bersani EES cc Subject Letter Credit Tracee Hi I was talking to a Tozzini lawyer and he said that that language on the side letter reputable institution is a kind of standard in Brazil for such kind of contracts but that it doesn t have any correlation to any credit rating standard So I believe we won t have any problems with the l c from Arab Bank I also read the fuel contract and realized that there is no restrictions or requirements for the letter of credit except for its amount How is the l c issuance

Cuiaba EPC/Changeorders - please respond","recipient_count":"1","message_body":"I like this conceptually as an approach to manage costs but see the potential problems with Shell if EECC is paid on time I think it may also be extremely difficult to rework the LD s because the EECC wrap does not match up with the subs very well in some cases EECC s protection exceeds the subs and in other is less I also wonder who is the credit for contractor obligations in this scenario for the lenders Peter E Weidler 01 20 2001 09 31 AM To Cuiaba Core team John Guidry NA Enron Enron cc Subject Cuiaba EPC Changeorders please respond I would like you all to consider the following concept and send back feedback Especially John Novak or Eddy on whether or not we have significant exposure with Shell by using this approach If EECC is not neccessarily in the for profit business and Enron s goal is to conclude the construction with as least cost as possible We need to eliminate the negotiations between EECC and the project Right now we get change orders from EECC which include a markup of 10 and are fluffed up because they know the project is going to object and negotiate and Shell is not going to be happy until we reduce the cost of the proposed change orders this is a waste of time but has become part of the continuous contractor prjoect dance EECC also has some profit within the turnkey portion of the job pipelines and powerplant and is also asking for early completion bonus on some things My concept is for Cuiaba team and EECC to go complete open book Let us analyze and categorize all of EECC s actual costs so we understand where we stand currently with respect to work performed under the turnkey and outside of turnkey and then we go straight to final negotiations with Conduto and Bolinter EECC and us will both jointly negotiate best deal possible using our combined knowledge Get the debate on EECC profit and whether or not it was appropriate to commission certain work or whether or not it was their fault or our fault out of the picture so everyone can focus on minimizing the total cost of this project from Enron s perspective We we conclude the process the project gets charged all direct costs and third party costs For those items which is clearly not the responsibility fo the project we offset those against profit and present the results to Shell We go to Shell and say here it is please audit and either approve or object Whatever the dispute we will negotiate and as a result 10mm profit may get decreased The advantage of this route is we work together to minimize overall cost of project we eliminate an intercompany debate which will cost time and money and Enron can undertand what the cost of this thing really is Right now I do not actually know how much of the capex is profit and could and should be deducted from our capex budget number as it relates to Enron s position in the project Downside is Shell may consider that Project management has violated its fudiciary responsibility to the project Although I think this can be mitigated by audit and prior explanation of what we are doing to Shell I do not really want Shell directly involved until we are done because I do not know what we will find or conclude Need help on fine tuning this part of the strategy Let me know if I have rocks in my head If this is a good idea I would like to run it to ground this week with EECC Pete "},{"received_time":"2001-01-22 07:26:00-08:00","sent_time":"2001-01-22

adequate warranty period on gas if there are additional delays on the P L our Insurance group has indicated that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption insurance when we go operational on gas This should solve the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects design and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits etc Incidentally for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event with US 150 000 deductible Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the insurer In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has ended then the insurer is the primary We will need to execute these agreements immediately Please advise with your thoughts as soon as possible "},{"received_time":"2001-01-31

to December 31 2001 as the note from Celso below explains Then we will just deliver request for extension letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to reflect the new maturity date This should all be done before the existing loans mature on December 31 2000 Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep you apprised of any developments

everyone we were able to create a robust and compelling project in spite of numerous detractors and doubters This latest development only reinforces the value of your efforts Please note that we still have interests in Nigeria notably an EPC contract for the Barges and we remain engaged in a strategic alliance with AES and YF Power to ensure the successful evacuation of power to all Nigerians via the Barge project and the IPP as quickly as possible Notwithstanding this sale we remain committed to this endeavor and believe that the alliance is the most expedient vehicle to the realization of everyone s goals If you happen to have discussions with outsiders regarding these projects please do your part to quell the notion that Enron has abandoned the project Feel free to talk to me

know any more It s true there is a lot of pressure and I m sure Laine is absorbing most of the blows I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself It s true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay attention to the flood of e mails this project generates each day However as you know my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually find the e mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights It s also true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the loop such apparently was the case here I think it is unreasonable to assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that these two young associates can even discern everything that is important They are really struggling with the complexity of this project everything is new to them and they don t have the benefit of experience to know what is normal As a result increased patience and communication are in order At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position I think we made great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday although albeit in a painful fashion I want to reassure both you and Laine that I am committed to getting this done I no longer have anything on my plate but this and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by the numerous folks nosing around The tough projects are what determine what we are made of I am

I am not sure this is the case or if you even need to read all the notes that come to you but you may want to just ask Tracee to automatically forward you everything that you are not copied on Overall

ONS dispatch the power plant for 300MW we do not have reinburshment for the amount above 150 MW We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at the same time They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis and giving the answers at beginning of the new year About if there is any documents about this subject the answer is no Second point Under the FURNAS s point of view these constrains in the transmission system is good for both FURNAS and EPE because from the EPE s side we receive all invoice available capacity and even if the plant is in the merit order it will not be dispatched because these constrains So in this case we do not consume oil more than 150 MW and FURNAS will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be constrain off in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not dispatched Best regards L cio Reis "},{"received_time":"2000-12-21

because Cuiaba failed to generate Therefore I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along the lines of 1 If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl What is the extent of damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements 2 Could any consequential damages be assessed 3 Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid documents the PPA or other agreements with Furnas Electronote or Eletrabras 4 How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement which was payable by EPE Could the process be expedited to avert a liquidity crisis 5 Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage 6 Similarly could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of the agreements 7 Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons such as access to back up power which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under the PPA 9 Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability 10 A question for insurance Does our Business Interuption insurance protect us in any of these instances Note the US 20MM Sponsor liquidity facility provides
